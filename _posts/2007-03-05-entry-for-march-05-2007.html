<div style="text-align:center;"><font size="4"><strong>Where knowledge is bliss, you better be wise!!</p>
<p>     </strong></font></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"> Well in one of my blogs I did talk about Bangalore, but lately i realised that I had written more about the ambience and natives than about the IT class. 80,000 IT professionals in one city!! that sounds fascinating and feels even great to be part of such a group. A typical IT professional who is outwardly lethargic during weekends, doing things like waking up at 11:00 , not having bath at least on one of the two days becomes surprisingly efficient for the five days that follow the weekend. But this is something that most of us know and have talked about a great deal. There is one more striking characteristic that I guess has surfaced only recently. I think in most of these IT guys' office bags apart from, documents and books on JAVA , .NET ,ORACLE another book has found a sort of permanent place. That book surprisingly has little to do with IT or even computers for that matter. It can be any book, may be a book on philosophy or history or even a simple fiction cum thriller. But the point is its there.<br />     People here have started reading not just to gain knowledge but also as part of a common trend. There are groups of friends who live in different flats and meet after weekends and love to discuss what did they read during the two day long break!. For whom weekend is best spent with a continuous supply of tea or coffee and good thick thought provoking book! For whom reading or writing has become more than a hobby. For whom it is now the best way to tackle stress of  demanding jobs. Whose spectrum of knowledge is so vast that you pick up any topic under the sun and they always have something to talk about it.<br />     When you see around there are people who can talk about British rule with as much ease as they can talk about Ajax!! They seem to know it all from Lenin to Vista!! I feel there is a singular    intellectual consciousness that is taking shape. <br />     Being with such a company always provokes you to read more and more. These people seem to have an insatiable thirst to gain knowledge about as diverse areas as possible. I have been fortunate to be with few such people myself and have learnt a lot from them i guess it is the best way to prove worthy of such a company cuz here Knowledge is bliss and you better be wise!!! </div>
