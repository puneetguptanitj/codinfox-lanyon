<p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;"><font size="3"> No where is now here!!</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">"Sully, for shame!" Jonathan said in reproach, "and don't be foolish!What are we trying to practice every day? If our friendship depends on things like space and time, then when we finally overcome space and time, we've destroyed our own brotherhood! But overcome space, and all we have left is Here. Overcome time, and all we have left is Now. And in the middle of Here and Now, don't you think that we might see each other once or twice?"</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Sully was sad that he might not see Jonathan again as Jonathan would be "somewhere else".But Jonathan explains it that when things are now and here they are inseparable as the differences are imperceptible. I think somewhere nowhere and everywhere share the same level of abstraction. Nowhere is somewhere and both are everywhere.When an electron jumps from one orbit to the other its position cannot be determined. It is nowhere , but it is somewhere and hence it is everywhere. In short it is now here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every thing that you are aware of, everything that u can perceive is nothing but what u possess and essentially belong the space time domain. You have a body but you are not your body. You have a skin, you have some senses but you are not them then who are you? Advaite Vedanta says there is only one Bhrama which is nothing but the soul and that IS you. But if there is only one soul then there is only one you or me. This means that we share the sense of being. And surprisingly the literal meaning of consciousness is indeed sharing of being. Hence consciousness is the common thread that weaves everything together. The electron is in the domain of consciousness during that transition and hence we cannot be AWARE of where when or how it is. In that domain things are self aware and beyond any form of perception. Thus no matter what anything has, everything IS consciousness, the universe IS consciousness. And hence we live in a self aware universe there is only one "is - a" relationship every other form of association essentially takes a "has â€“ a" form. The great Gull or the "code " are all nothing but different names of this self aware consciousness and those who are near to it like Jonathan understand that it is now here, that now and here there is a world beyond boundaries of time and space<span>  </span>a world where every gull is bright and swift a world where every gull flies!!</p>
