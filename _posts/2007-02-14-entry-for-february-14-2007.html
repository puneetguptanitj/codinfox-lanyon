<p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;"><font size="4">For those who have time neither for roses nor Moses!!</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> I guess its time for you guys to plan your own exodus!!!<span>  </span>How many of us have stopped looking beyond our cabinet's to do list. How many of us have stopped staring out of the window just to admire the beauty that lies beyond. To appreciate the flawless system that is up and running 24x7. (I mean the world! I thought you would understand it better this way). How many of us have got so pathetically tied to the routine that any change appears to be an intrusion. Just how many of us pray daily and not just in October!! (during appraisals!!). Today might be a good day to start loving the people around us rather than just writing down their extension numbers on our white boards. I guess this is a good day to start loving ourselves as well rather than just comparing our pay slips with fellow colleagues. Though I do not believe in the Valentine Crap! But I do believe this is not the way most of us had planned our lives to be. Because this is not life anyway!! What seems to me is that you need to unplug man!! <span> </span>Even if you don't have any roses to give or any Moses to follow ...get some life dude!!</p>
