<div style="text-align:center;"><font size="3"><strong>In the search of my own zion</strong></font></p>
<p>   in the search of my own zion i go <br />      to the cliff aloof alone<br />   to get a glimpse of what lies beyond<br />      cuz i no more can condone</p>
<p>   that i have to find a purpose in life<br />     an aim that i would treasure<br />   that i've slept for long enough now <br />     there are no more hours of lesiure</p>
<p>   every summit shines in sun<br />     but i need to find my own <br />   the summit that i've always dreamt of<br />     towards which, my every wish has flown</p>
<p>   its time i must realise <br />     that there is not much time to waste<br />   i need to set my goals and<br />     some success i must now taste</p>
<p>   I must not think of stopping again<br />     and must drive myself on the uphill climb<br />   undeterred by the sloping terrain <br />     towards my aim, the summit sublime</p>
<p>   </div>
