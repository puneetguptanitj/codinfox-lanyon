<p style="text-align:left;">don't look back for fear of guilt or complacency<br />
never look infront for fear of discouragement or illusory ascendancy</p>
<p>just think of the step u r about to take<br />
about the change it would bring ,<br />
the impact it would make</p>
<p>no matter how dark the past has been<br />
or how bleak the future might seem</p>
<p>immerse in the present, with this solemn vow<br />
to always be in this moment<br />
in this  limitless expanse of  here and now</p>
