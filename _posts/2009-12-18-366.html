<p style="text-align:center;">To do our job well and then step back,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">is an ability that most of us lack</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">fame after all is so alluring,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">we want it all the more after our efforts so enduring,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">we cannot deny the urge to be known,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">to shine and rightfully reap what was sawn,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">to enter the limelight to get to that center-stage,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">even if it alienates friends or even rouses rage,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">you enter that spot only to find,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">that wasn't the turn of events you had in mind,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">you smile but not very convincingly,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">surrounded by people you are but you start craving for meaning, insistently.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">There is no substance in glitter,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">glory is intoxicating but is also fickle,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">when you reach a state where acquaintances are many but friends are few,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">you realize that it far less important to be known, than simply being you,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">we might find it hard to believe, but the reality is this,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">contrary to popular belief anonymity is bliss.</p>
