<div style="text-align:center;"><font size="3"><strong>Man is not a social animal</strong></font> </div>
<p> 
<div style="text-align:justify;">Did you know that the QWERTY keyboard was designed in a manner, that it could slow down the typists so that the typewriter doe snot get jammed. But we are good in making assumptions, especially about things that have a past backing them up; and  we simply made millions of keyboards thinking that what we are making is customized to increase the typing speed.  Consider another such assumption that has a much lengthier, though dismal, past to back it up. Man is a  social animal, from my 20 years of discernible knowledge experience if I try to figure out the authenticity of this assumption I do not find much points. But I am not bewildered by it. I feel society is one such QWERTY keyboard, that we had presumed would cater to our needs of speed! rather it was meant to slow us down. Believe me MAN is NOT a social animal. Society is the chaotic place where we somehow try to maintain pace, hosteling our way out of own complexes and other's interests. The only thing that catches our attention about this system is its organization and structure how a family tree expands etc.. but this feeling has the potential of satiating the thirst for fascination of a child's eyes, when these eyes are watery with emotions, later as they get dessicated by the gust of hot air of reality, the fascination ends. It is like trying a bulky software, at first we love to use it, to maneuver our ways into the various controls of the application, but as the new region transforms into a know territory interest fades out. I think society is like one such software that is designed to make MAN understand that man is not a social animal. Have you ever wondered why have we fragmented the world into states, states into cities, cities to colonies, colonies to houses and houses to rooms? Why don't we stop before rooms or why don't we go any further? All that a man wants from this world is a room for himself, no society nothing. Man is just an animal with his concept of society not being larger than that of any other animal, no matter how hard we try to hide it by our so called reason and knowledge. In what way are we better than a group of dogs may be, they also fight any intruder out of their territory, they also cannot share a piece of bread, they also fight their own group mates, just because we have made ourselves some better toys to play with, or sophisticated weapons to fight doesn't make us any better.It might however, prove us as true hypocrites for sure. If I tell a butterfly that its actual life was the one that it lived inside cage of its larvae wouldn't it laugh at me,wouldn't it proudly show me its wings and fly off without paying any heed to my argument. Then why do we think that the life we are into right now in this chrysalis of the world is something great and something that we truly deserve, shouldn't we laugh at this notion, shouldn't we search for our wings, shouldn't we strive to achieve something more worthwhile. </div>
