<div style="text-align:center;"><font size="3">The myth of knowledge</font></p></div>
<p> Science is man's pursuit of understanding the world around him. After numerous years and countless achievements are we anywhere close to decipher the miracles of nature. I donot think so! Only that the we have started to live with our incompetencies in doing so. Physics for example has "uncertainty" as one of its principles! Math says every number is a complex number ... a number that invariably has an "imaginary" part only that the weight assigned to this part varies from negative infinity to positive infinity. <br /> Positive what?<br /> ... infinity !! <br /> Is that a number?<br /> .. well yes..<br /> .. ok then is it a rational number or is it irrational , real or complex <br /> well it can be anything<br /> Really!! then these sets are not disjoint are they ? well.... <br /> If Chemistry has a set of rules it also has a set of exceptions. How easily we accept the presumptions and assumptions. Haven't we being fooling ourseleves... <br /> Is it a cynical view of our journey and efforts? No..not at all. Science has a purpose, its purpose is to give wings to human thought. To open a new window to see the world but it certainly doesnot give us details. It can't because knowledge is essentially a relative phenomenon. A civilisation can enjoy an intellectual ascendancy but even that could be easily humbled by a smarter civilisation prospering in some other part of the globe or at some other time. Thus it is comaparable and hence relative therefore tied to the space time domain. Thus is inherently incapable of explaining the phenoemon that takes place outside that domain. In order to challenge those limits we need something absolute something higher and more complete... like ....spirituality maybe!!</div>
