<p style="text-align:justify;">My fervent desire to work against entropy springs up from its very definition. It is the degree of disorder. I feel tormented when entropy wins against humans when time overpowers the otherwise flawless minds and when boredom and loss of reason become excuses for quick escape from, what would have been, a meaningful existence. Boredom is a concept and so is time. We are neither and nor are we their slaves. But the utter capitulation infront of this rising disorder leaves us with no option but to get tied to regrets and anticipations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Entropy's most powerful weapon is its aperiodicity, it grows and is encountered monotonically. A sudden (aperiodic event) rise/ fall in expectations, likes, dislikes etc.. are all examples of growing craving to digress. Which compels us to spread out our attention until it reduces to its thinnest trace.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Periodicity on the other hand is controlled, predictable and maintainable. Had sun been rising at random occasions, it would have lead to utter chaos.  Repeated nature of this event makes it anticipatable and thus allows us to plan what we want to do next.<br />
We are nothing but embedded boards on this "mother" earth board! we can schedule our tasks (till our period on this earth) such that we accomplish something worthwhile or we can cater to  unscheduled  events like servants, as and when they choose to appear. Routine comes to our rescue and lets us schedule our life with gant charts taking one day at a time. If one day is fulfilling, it is reassuring and almost certain that a similar day would be as pleasing. But not until we have created a feasible schedule with considerable utilization. All we need to do next is to repeat the schedule. Aperiodic/ Sporadic events would still prop up but we can handle them at our will and not without succumbing to their deadline pressures.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This approach most definitely takes out the surprise element which might, at times, take away some fun, but gives in return peace and control which appears to be a good deal.</p>
