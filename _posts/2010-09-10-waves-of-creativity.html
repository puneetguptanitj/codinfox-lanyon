<p style="text-align:justify;">After having waited for 3 months and few more days for a wave of creativity to take me to the shore, I finally decide to swim on my own (too little too late some might argue, but it's still a step nonetheless). These 3 months however made me realize two very important things, creativity is more like a seed which sprouts in only a fertile soil, and that soil is a patient but, ironically enough, troubled mind. It has happened to me far too often that I can’t convince myself otherwise. A troubled or, to make it look less frightening, a mind that is over stretched,after having hit rock bottom, pierces through and an idea gushes out. Not before, not without any less effort. But finally the juice appears to be worth the squeeze after all. Swami Vivekananda had said "if you are not facing any problem you can be sure that you are on the wrong track" as a corollary to it if your mind is not "creating" anything, probably it is operating way below its limits. An original idea, irrespective of its magnitude or extent of its impact is a gift of walking that extra mile. Second thing is that, the epicenter of creativity lies outside human periphery, human mind being just a receiver of the seed not the seed itself. Which seems to question the very reach of human mind, a mind that is so dependent on something outside its domain of control, doesn’t appear to be worthwhile! what if no such “seed” finds my mind worthy enough. Well the ubiquity of such nuggets of creation comes to rescue here. Somehow it matches with Stephen Covey's idea of abundance. So much of our troubles can be removed by shifting the origin of perception to region of abundance. There have been billions before us and there would be billions more. There is enough for every one. Lets start from there. So what?, I just sit and wait for one such seed. Well yeah.. Just keep the soil fertile. And be ready with your board next time you are hit by one such wave. A true magnet is bound to attract, a mind as flawless as ours, bound to create!</p>
