<p style="text-align:justify;">As I enter into a room named moment I am baffled by its expanse. It appeared to be so tiny from the outside but is magnificent from the inside. Sculptures, paintings , mysteries, labyrinths you name it. As I delve into the details I get absorbed completely in the intoxicating sense of presence. Being cut off from everything else and tied only to the moment. I start finding every bit of detail and suddenly room appears even more spacious. A simple room has so much to offer. How many such rooms I might have overlooked I wonder, just because I did not have company or was too worried to keep pace with others in hurry. Its rather immaculate, no stains of past no dust of future. As if it has been carved out of time itself, free from the attraction and stagnation of space. Only a flawless continuum of ticks.  God... its beautiful, I say to myself. How long would it take for people like myself to understand that there is more to life that being a restless passenger, sometimes it is more rewarding to just stop, wonder and admire</p>
