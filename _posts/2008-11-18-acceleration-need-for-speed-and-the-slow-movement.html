<p style="text-align:center;">Acceleration, need for speed and the slow movement</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em>Disclaimer</em>: <em>Besides owing every part of every blog to the world, I owe this one in particular to the ted video...Â  http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/carl_honore_praises_slowness.html</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Acceleration, I would argue, eats the time it seems to generate. Thus it need not actually generate, at the first place, and would definitely use it for itself whatever it generates, if at all. I am not the only person who is against moving fast, this fast, there are slow movements started in various parts of the world having enormous number of people, that are emphasizing the importance of slowing down. Moving slow or fast is therefore a matter of choice, and we better make it wisely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Einstein said that we always move with the speed of light, but our speed in space is neglible as compared to our speed in time. Interestingly speed is distance over time, then what is speed in time dimension. I think it is simply traveling more in the life span that we have. Thus if we seem to have more time than others in the same life span i guess we are moving faster in time than others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now speed in space would eat its magnitude from the speed in time. Therefore more the frenzy lesser would be the time available! it is so direct. In order to have more time (move fast in time) we would have to slow down in space.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Doing something slowly allows us to "connect" to it. Running through it is like going for a ride to see the scenery around but doing so at jet speed. It would hardly suit the eyes! Get connected, slow down, take a while to step back and ask what is it that I am doing. What do I intend to do here. Why did I open this site, what is it that I want to Google. What is that I am searching for, what is it that I want to read. Doing it slowly gives you a moment to think and to figure out whether you really want to do it? Rather than hurriedly going to inbox it allows us to think that I just checked the mail a minute ago, and surely heavens have not fallen since then, I can skip this round of checking the mail. This allows us to filter important from the unimportant. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Doing more is different from achieving more. Doing fast is not same as doing well. Doing slow is not same as not doing at all. Pace is good but reckless pace is not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As you might have heard in the movie Shooter, Slow and smooth... smooth is fast that's it! </p>
