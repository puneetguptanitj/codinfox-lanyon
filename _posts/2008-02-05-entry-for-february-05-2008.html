Trinity:  "Because  you have been down there Neo, you know that lane you know exactly where it ends and I know thats not where you want to be"</p>
<p>Is art losing  to mechanization because of our need for speed and equality? There might be a time when equality would eat up all diversity. When each room will have same dimensions, same almirahs, same amount of light and air, just to make the pricing easy. What would we gain? perhaps some time, but what would we lose? ... almost everything else! When any digression from the protocol would be treated as an aberration by the merciless patrons of unerring regularity. When looking out of a window would no longer be fun. Same structures would exist for miles together with annoying similarity. Filmed glasses rudely reflecting back every ray. Conditioned air making all natural phenomenon redundant. Slaves of technology flagrantly displaying their progress blindly moving with ever faster speed in the neural interactive simulation. But if you would see down the concrete chasm you might find someone staring at the relentless giants of steel and glass. Trying to find some inch for his skill but alas there would be none. Human art as people used to call him would depart realizing his obvious uselessness leaving behind machines having a mocking smile, over organized roads, hopelessly well formed cities, fixed framed buildings, identical cabinets, same shaped chairs, mechanized human beings and limitless extent of lifeless uniformity.</p></div>
