<p><em>I enter into a restaurant called OSs, and am met with a loud and flamboyant waiter, I need not ask his name he has his name written all over him, vista he calls himself and is wearing the costliest suit i have ever  seen. He is  cherrleading and trying to draw attention as if he is the best one in the lot, surprisingly no one else is paying any heed to him, rather few are even showing him some pity. None the less the restaurant owner Mr. P C Manufacturer comes in and the waiter quickly slides a 20$ dollar note in his pocket and Manufacture then says</em></p>
<p><strong>PCM: sir he is the best service man i have seen in my whole life, i proudly recommend vista, he has grown a bit fat as compared to his predecessor but he works just fine. </strong><br />
<strong>I: ok, if ur so sure. </strong></p>
<p><em>Just as quickly he had come, so he departs.  I prepare my self to give some order. Suddenly vista springs out a card from his pocket which read, my menu service has failed, surprised as i already was, I said </em></p>
<p><strong>I:no problem I know what to order.</strong></p>
<p><em>He didn't seem to listen. Suddenly another card comes  out, my pen service is also not working wait while i collect the data for this problem. I am unable to convince vista that its ok I would lend him my pen. I wait till one of the card goes from where it had come. The second one is still in front of my face, it takes me some time to figure out that i have to touch the right corner to get rid of the card.</em></p>
<p><em>but as soon as i am done<br />
</em><br />
<strong>vista: would you like to connect to the internet.</strong></p>
<p><strong>i: no i just want to eat something,</strong></p>
<p><strong>vista: oh that ! but would you like to connect to the </strong><strong>internet</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I:(a bit loudly), no thank you. </strong><em>Then a few minutes later he popped again</em><strong>,</strong></p>
<p><strong>vista:  would like to connect to the internet.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I: ok if that is what it takes to eat, go ahead log me in.</strong></p>
<p><strong>vista:  Hmm, </strong><em>he turns serious, wears a dark wizard like cloak and closes his eyes and ears, the cloak has a question written on it , u have asked to connect to the internet, allow or cancel?</em></p>
<p><strong>I: What is your problem, first i did not want to connect ,then u forced me to say yes, now u are asking whether or not to proceed. </strong><em>He is all blank now, no clap of hands or snapping of fingures seem to reach his ears.</em></p>
<p><strong>I: ALLOW,<br />
vista:ah!  what took u so long?!</strong></p>
<p><strong>I ( </strong><em>frowning now</em><strong>) :Can i get some food now</strong></p>
<p><strong>vista:sure sir, what would u like,<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>i: some docs and a ppt sauce should be fine,</strong></p>
<p><strong>vista:OH!! u fat slob !! (</strong><em>murmurs</em><strong>) that will take a lot of time,</strong></p>
<p><strong>i:and why is that?, u don't seem to be busy and besides there is enough room,</strong></p>
<p><strong>vista: ah! all that is for me u see, i eat a lot myself! (</strong><em>chuckles</em><strong>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>i: Whatever just go and get what i want.</strong></p>
<p><strong>vista: fine.</strong></p>
<p><em>After a long time he comes back with 3kg plate and 1 meter long bottle.<br />
</em><br />
<strong>i:Hell! what is that??</strong></p>
<p><strong>vista:docs and ppt? why?</strong></p>
<p><strong>i:don't u see i am a single person sitting here?</strong></p>
<p><strong>vista: we offer the same size to every one , single or family. It makes our lives more convenient</strong></p>
<p><strong>i:and what about mine??</strong></p>
<p><strong>vista: oh..oh.. never thought about that.</strong></p>
<p><strong>i: ok just leave it and get lost</strong></p>
<p><strong>vista:hm.. , btw ur not connected to the Internet anymore.</strong></p>
<p><strong>i: GET OUT!<br />
</strong><br />
<em>As i start unwrapping the food, the tape would just not come out, vista from the second table, shouted,<br />
</em><br />
<strong>vista: ur food packing is not responding, end now or cancel. </strong></p>
<p><em>I throw everything off the table and dash my way out of that place.</em></p>
<p><em>before leaving I see the quite corners called appleville and ubuntu town, people enjoying their meal, no waiters to be seen unless asked for, I feel tormented and even jealous. How a waiter came with a proper menu card took the order and brought back not just food but a cheer delight to the table. I regret the moment when had chosen that table and especially that waiter.</em></p>
