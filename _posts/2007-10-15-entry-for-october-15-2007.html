<div style="text-align:center;"><font size="3"><strong>Take a different lane today</strong></font></div>
<p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Someone has taken a different route to office today, he goes through a lane, there is not much activity, most of the houses are empty. While walking he comes across gardens, abandoned of course, these unkept patches of land must have been blooming beauties at some time he thought. He lost all haste and is on a gentle amble now, Derelict houses broken shops, why are they empty he asks but all he gets back is a deafening silence. How easily this simple place is deriding all human artifacts and the race of hoarding more and more. Even when everyone knows that one day his own house would be on a similar lane. He is already late but he doesn't care and wants to go to every room of every house. Doors creak as he tries to enter, some rooms still have toys kept he heard a gentle laughter he turned right only to see the busy road. Why are they running, for what, for whom, till when! Nothing remains for ever ... relatives are lost, relationships are broken and one day you find yourself unable to run anymore. Is that what life means these days. To run fast ,faster rather! , then finally die out realising the worthlessness of all the undertaking and accomplishments. Life is not all about speed it is also about completeness and essence. He cries for help, he feels terribly lonely not because of the empty room but because of emptiness of heart that is very much inside him too, which will one day manifest itself in similar vacant corridors Silent porches and ugly gardens. When oneday he would find himself left out of this race, when he will lose touch of almost everyone he knows today. Its not his house but he wants to see it filled with people again, wants to replace laughter by laughter , flower by flower, he wants to see people talking and kids playing but there are none, they have lost themselves somewhere on a similar road, in a similar race. Things should improve he cries in agony , That someone i guess is in every one, he is the one who fills your mind with childhood memories,who once in a while takes you to a different lane, one who wants to be home! Lets not silent him this time, he doesn't speak too often, lets take him where he wants to be. Lets shift the priorities, change the paradigms, to encompass not only money or status but also people and relationships.So that the wonderful continum of human effort is never broken, so that it finds meaning and not just bricks fame and gold. </div>
