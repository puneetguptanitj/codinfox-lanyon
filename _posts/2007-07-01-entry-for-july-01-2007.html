<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Georgia,Helvetica;"><font size="3"><strong>Object Oriented Programming .. even God found it handy!</strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;font-family:Georgia,Helvetica;"> When a child is born its incessant cry fills the room with joy, concern, excitement, love and yes relatives!! In those small eyes that are to witness miraculously built world for years to come, lies unfathomable curiosities. Those small eyes that find it so hard to open in their nascent state would see dreams and those little hands will work to achieve them. Those little legs will show the path to so many and that sweet voice might one day fill his contemporaries with confidence. Those eyes would see the world initially at the lowest level of abstraction where only way to understand or recognize two things would be to understand the differences between them. That's a dog, that's a cat... only the differences would be the basis of learning. If we see clearly when we are born we see the leaf nodes of the class hierarchy of the world!! Wow!!. Every instance of the class of this hierarchy essentially differs from the instances of other classes. So obviously the very first impression is not of commonalities but of diversity and distinguishing features. Later as we grow up quite interestingly the education as well starts focusing on the commonalities... dogs cats are mammals just like humans, everything is ultimately a collections of atoms... then suddenly everything is just energy and waves! It seems that as we know more about the world we do not start to neglect the differences but we start appreciating the similarities along the way... in a sense we rise up higher in the class hierarchy of the world ... we try to look to the world at a level of abstractions<span>  </span>and quite interestingly it is related to rising higher! Now if we further attempt to understand the world if we turn towards religion.. it teaches us "love thy neighbour as thyself" ... "we are all children of god..." there is only one god and we all have it in us.... "rise above the opposites" and thus above the entire vista of differences lying between the opposites .... The more we want to know about the world the more we are forced to accept that everything is nothing but a manifestation of the One, and we are all here to make our journeys in our own sweet ways back to that whole... similar to the object class!! Every instance of every class has something inherited from the object that I guess forces the instance to return to the whole ... understanding of the world is ofcourse not a one births job! But yes there are indeed hidden silent but powerful similarities between how we have created our own world in computers and how the almighty did something strikingly similar... <span style="font-size:10pt;"></span></p>
