<p align="center" style="text-align:center;">
<p align="center" style="font-weight:bold;text-align:center;"><font size="4">So how about taking a quantum leap into potentia!!</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">We triumphed over our discoveries and knowledge of natural phenomenon....when we started thinking that every wonder of nature could be pinned down to some sequences of cause and effect ..when material realism reinforcing causal determinism questioned the very existence of mind sphere treating it as no more than another epiphenomenona of matter...</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even consciousness and god reduced to just another higher states of matter. Thereby eradicating the creativity of nature from the root!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But things changed...some extraordinary achievements of some extraordinary geniuses changed our perception of real. </p>
<p>Planck gave the theory of quantisation of energy which was reaffirmed by Einstein's light photons ... later<span> </span>De broglie proposed the stationary matter waves and Schrodinger actually gave the equation of matter waves!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Matter waves!! Rings a bell doesn't it...if matter were wave how do we find every object in precise locations because if they were waves they should be spread over space and time... true...the answer to this strange puzzle is hidden in Heisenberg's uncertainty principle which says that uncertainty in measuring the velocity increases as you approach closer to the object. You know the velocity for sure when you have no idea where the particle is ... probably in potentia!!! However this uncertainty reduces as mass increases so, apparent classical nature of material objects of sufficient masses camouflages their quantum selves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus what we see is essentially determined by what we want to see!! Electron behaves as particle if we try to measure its position and behaves as a wave if we wish to measure the diffraction patterns......its not the spoon that bends!!!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus if what we see around are all quantum waves ....who collapses these waves do give them a space-time reality who does the measurement for us all the time. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the trajectory of the electron is untraceable when it jumps from one orbit to the other ...where it exactly is during that transition ...in potentia that is outside the space-time domain.. Where in lies the single unitive consciousness, which does the measurement for us....and collapses all the wave functions so that we can perceive the world as we do!!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this unitive consciouness does all the job what purpose do we have... well our brain is also a quantum object whose wave function is also collapsed by the consciousness..however like any other object it essentially has a quantum part and a not so quantum!! or classical part ...which stores every pattern of the wave collapses and thus biasing future collapses to the stored pattern..this gives us the sense of I or a sense of self ...however we must realize that this sense of self is nothing but the manifestation of the stored patterns.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:12pt;">The moment we try to overrule these patterns and allow our quantum minds to take over from that very moment we will be capable of experiencing the brilliance of creativity of that single unitive consciousness <span></span>or in other words ... of taking a quantum leap!!!!</span></p></p>
