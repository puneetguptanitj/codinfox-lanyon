<div style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:center;">     <strong>Why is it important to have constructive hobbies?</strong></p>
<p>  </p>
</p></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Water trickles down onto a clay pattern. It essentially takes the path through the curves that the pattern provides thus reinforcing the patterns and hence increasing the probability of that pattern being chosen by future water streams. Similarly a stimulus falls on neural patterns of our brains. The final position of the stimulus within that pattern decides our response and in turn increases the probability of the same response in case we receive a similar stimulus. Thus how we react decides our future reactions to the same stimulus. Where is habit in this crap!! Well if anybody is complacent regarding this robotic stimulus â€“ response behavior he doesn't need to bother but for others to explore beyond these patterns we need to create PROPER vents through the rigid walls of these patterns. Constructive hobbies do that job for us. Saying that these vents are nothing but digressions is same as saying that, let a Pentium IV 3.0 GHz PC handle only one task at a time don't let it multitask or digress from one thread of execution! Our brain can handle much more than what we are assigning to it right now so in absence of proper vents reckless cracks would be created!!   </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The more varied the hobbies be, the greater would be the area explored out side those patterns. When these new patches of newly explored territory would work together ... result would be great synergy!! Having a constructive hobby is like having a quite room all for yourself. A room where you do not go often but whenever you enter it you feel like staying there for a while. Here you can feel your own presence, can talk to yourself, can see yourself. It adds purpose to routine things. If your hobby is writing you start reading for a purpose .. unknowingly you start retaining what you've read. As you start writing you slowly become a better reader, a better listener as well. If your hobby is photography you start looking for beauty around you. The same world appears to offer so much ,worth being captured in your camera! A proper vent is created in the pattern that used to guide your perception. You start concentrating on what you would like to capture rather than what you would not! you start paying attention to the positives of every view you see and you become more observant.This was the synergy that I was talking about!</p>
<p>And of course the feeling of doing something extra is very satisfying in itself. It makes you feel more complete.   </p>
