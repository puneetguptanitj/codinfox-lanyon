<div style="text-align:center;"><font size="3"><strong>From joint families to nuclear family to individualism what next <br /> do you want to die alone??!!</strong></font> </div>
<p> 
<div style="text-align:justify;">Anything that is not in line with nature is made to get perished later on. Eons of civilisations, limitless extent of kingdoms emerged and found a worthy place in the annals of human history but what has remained? Their debris and nature's triumph. Is there anything nuclear in nature? Living beings are connected and hence made interdependent in the joint family of food chain. Clouds, rain rivers lakes ponds plants all are happily dependent on each other. Clouds lose their existence only to satiate the thirst of plants. Plants give their lives to let others live. Rivers lose their identity to oceans. Ocean selflessly gives its portion to clouds. Nature is a joint family and that too a heterogenous one. Still after all human endeavours and progress we find ourselves at the mercy of mother nature. I donot deny the potential and energy of an individual. Like an atom an individual is a quantum block of society and has tremendous energy. But what good is that energy if, when left uncontrolled has the power only to destroy. Since when did we accept the fellowship of this ring of power?! Nuclear family fission is according to me a similar chain reaction where, in every link of the chain we are destroying one step closer relations. When at every step these relations appear to be burdensome and worth severing apart. It is the cohesion between the atoms that makes multitudes of molecules and gives diversities of nature. The power of nature lies in this conglomerate rather than in monotonic confinement to atomic individuality. What we are heading towards is nothing but an uncontrolled fission reaction that is breaking apart all the bonds. The intoxication of the energy of freedom is driving us blind and taking us to the bleak dreary and dreadful future of me I and myself.</div>
