<p style="text-align:justify;">Our brain and the web are strikingly similar. Both are huge networks of interconnected entities. And a pattern of this interconnected entities fetches us the information we desire. Brain stores information that is more in content and easier in retrieval as compared to the web. Both share another reality (though unsettling) that both can be very easily mismanaged. My contention is that the way we are using web (carelessly) is impacting how we are using our brains. The brains so transformed are what i call as the browser brains. Brains tuned and accoustomed to long hours of browsing. Such brains communicate using HTML (Hyper Thought Messy Languages) brains jump from one thought to the other as if following links while browsing. Thoughts digress easily and it is very difficult to follow one line of thought. The problem is again the large (neural in this case) network at disposal. I also feel that there is some relation between the attention span of a person and the amount of time he/she spents on "one" web page. Even after getting the page that we seem to be searching our quest seldom ends. It is analogus to the situation where we get the thought stream to follow still seem to digress in search of something else without devoting proper time to what we had found. A browser brain, i would like to add, is rarely overwhelmed by the breadth but finds hard to tackel the depth of a problem. It is easier for such a brain to brainstorm than to single things out. It always seem to be tempted towards switching contexts or jumping to conclusion. Now I donot want to say that all this is the result of browsing but the similarities are hard to miss or neglect. It seems to enhance iterative thinking by increaing the cycles but reducing the outcome of individual cycles. Just as unorganised browsing has somewhat spoilt our thinking buds! an organised one can help us improve a great deal as well. Intend is to prune and consolidate web browsing. To read just for the love of it, Google reader can be a nice way to consolidate. Limiting the maximum number of sites that we surf each day (easier said than done .. i know) can help us prune unwanted and impulsive surfing. Less of surfing and more of reading should be our aim. Surfing is superficial by definition. Surfing should be used to reach the island (web page we finally want to read) but not beyond. Thinking and need should drive web browsing and not the other way round</p>
