<p> 
<div style="text-align:justify;">I dare to say that many of the man made institutions to facilitate human interaction and well being are rather no more than fetters for man himself. Knowledge and its pursuit is rather an attempt to gain solitude and joy together!  Friend circle for example binds you to align yourself to senseless and aimless whims of someone else, it develops a feeling of elusive dependence for no reason, and suddenly we need friends for everything. Peace is lost with every such interaction when you sidetrack yourself and turn into a copy cat whose only attempt is to somehow emulate somebody to the best of one's capacity and immolate oneself along the way.  I have grown a bit cynical about such groups or cliques rather. Why should one indulge and intrude in someone else's circle of concern and interest. Why should one be forced to affix oneself to some company no matter how incongruent it is with one's own way of life. Living alone is tough and probably bad but living in a group is harder and worse. Walls of individual enclaves should be respected. All breaches from either side cause disruption and nothing else. Any fissure in this wall can bring down the whole bulwark, as can be empirically ascertained by broken window theory. Nothing is permanent but for change, I really wish this axiom could be soiled by contradiction at least when it comes to people and their behaviour, but alas it suits this situation the best. People change and very often the change is not for the better. Even those whom you respect get indulged in filthy worldly gain-loss calculation , all genuine feelings go ersatz and every eye pathetically gets a mercenary vision and myopia of avarice. People are downgraded to things and things to belongings. This pursuit takes detours at debacles and ends in cataclysm if at all. </div>
