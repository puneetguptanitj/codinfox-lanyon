<p style="text-align:justify;">I happened to read a book recently "Practicing the power of now" I was baffled by the simplicity with which the chapters had been crafted and the equal ease with which ideas were put forth. It was then when I thought of writing this blog.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Time and mind are so intertwined that it is tough to see either in isolation. What is time? if there is such a thing. How do we perceive time. Time in itself may not exist but time intervals most certainly do. We might not be able to tell what 3 am means, but we can surely tell what a day is. We can sense that few events are occurring at regular intervals. This allows us to differentiate things that are slower/faster than others, as we can compare and contrast time intervals. Starting from this ability emanates the possibility of the existence of an entity which we call time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mind is the memory foot print of time, as time passes it leaves its imprints on this mind disk. From this data originate anticipations which when taken together are collectively called future. Mind would know about present only when it gets recorded but by that time it is gone! that means that mind is essentially a non-entity in the current moment. Just as time vanishes as the interval thins out, similarly mind dissolves as past and future shrink to NOW. Mind exists in/and because of, past and future and is surprisingly absent in present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is this relatively simple but exceedingly powerful idea that the book tries to anchor in the readers minds. Its powerful because it proves to us in a very different and rather conclusive way that living one moment at a time is bound to free us from past and future.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Time in effect is not an absolute reality it is instead relative and subjective. It is a personal belonging none other than your own mind. Just as beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder, time lies in the mind of the observer</p>
