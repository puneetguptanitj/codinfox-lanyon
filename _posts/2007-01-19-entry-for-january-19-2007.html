<p>FOLLOW THE WHITE RABBIT.......IF YOU CAN!!!! <br /></span></strong>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><strong></p>
<p></strong>"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!" Alice follows him down the rabbit hole into Wonderland. That commences her journey into the dreamworld .... From there on white rabbit became the symbol of starting a new journey,relationship .. <br />The MATRIX is one such wonderland Trinity asks Neo to follow the white rabbit to let him into this dreamworld of simultated reality. To start the adventure ....!! <br />Neo believes that there is something about the place he lives in that calls for some explanation ... He lives in an apartment number 101. As per George Orwell he should have been brain washed!! and should have started believing that whatever he sees ..feels...experiences is all real..but he has a problem with authority ...he believes that some how the rules donot apply to him ..he doesn't believe in fate as well rather believes that he controls his own life.... <br />Being a Hacker Thomas has this hunch that even the place he lives in is a computer generated virtual world and that even it can also be hacked... </p>
<p>Writing this blog is following the white rabbit for me as well as. Honestly i donot know how the future blogs would shape up ..will i be able to carry on with this discussion ..will i be able to put forth my interpretations of the movie and various pieces of related literature that i have read ... </p>
<p>But one thing is certain that it is worth an attempt!!!! </p>
