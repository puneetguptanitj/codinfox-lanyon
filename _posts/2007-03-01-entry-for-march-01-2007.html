<div style="text-align:center;"><strong><font size="4">Let them come!!!</font></strong></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Two million Persian soldiers are marching towards Athens. Sparta is the only way to reach Athens. There are only 300 troops in Sparta and Leonidas leads them. They have two options retreat or die. They gladly choose the latter. Leonidas says to his men "Today we save our land and die with honour... but before that lets enjoy a small party in hell!!". Spartans were all prepared for their last stand, but the Persians were not prepared for such a display of courage. They suffered heavy casualties and were forced to take help from a Spartan betrayer to get across Sparta!! But the ferocious battle gave Athens time to prepare for the Battle of Salamis where Persians were defeated. <br />But that was 480BC some might argue! Well how about Battle of <span class="misspell">Longewala</span> 1971AD, Strategic point to enter the western front of out country. 3000 Enemy soldiers backed up by armoured regiment were charging towards our post having just 120 soldiers of 23rd Battalion Punjab Regiment. Again they were asked to retreat...they did not. Our enemy must have thought it would just be a child's play. But even their tanks could not pass through the wall of bone and flesh of our great soldiers. <br />What gives these men the courage to hold their ground! when they even seem to defeat death in their last stand! <br />I think that it is the power of belief, and the piousness of the purpose that ignites this fire! When it is not how many YOU are, but how many THEY are that seems to charge you up. When unknowingly you grasp your sword harder, when eyes stop blinking and heart seems to pound faster than ever before and when the mind is filled with just one thought ..let them come!! </div>
