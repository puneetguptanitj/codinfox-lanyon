<p style="text-align:justify;">Genius as energy, I think, is constant. You can not create or destroy it you can only transform or transfer it. I believe that it has now been distributed amongst a lot of us. We might not be close to Da vinci but together we are performing miracles everyday. Together as a community powered with platforms to share (fast enough to contribute simultaneously), we are seeing what was absent in most part of human history and that is, the possibility of a collective brain. Neural network of which is of course the World Wide Web. Thoughts are travelling at speeds they rightly deserve. And are able to reach their worthy recipients in time. This is a beginning of an end, I believe.Â  End of accumulation of Intellectual wealth. A whole new society of equals is being formed, every member of which is a contributor and receiver of thought streams. Each one has a voice and also is willing to lend a ear. Things are no longer restricted by geography or biology if you can think and convey, your are in. As was pointed out by Evan Williams (Twitter CEO) who said, if you give people better and easier ways to share more good things happen. This is promising but also frightening. Promising because of the unimaginable acceleration it can bring to the advancement of human existence, and frightening for pretty much the same reason. It is unimaginable and unpredictable. The change is inconceivable because even thinking about it takes time, but for sure it is going to be rapid. In the words of Maria Rilke, "The loneliest people above all contribute the most to commonality" I guess now its time for the commonality to take charge!</p>
