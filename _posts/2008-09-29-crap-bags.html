<p style="text-align:center;">Jeene kee life ka yahi to hai tashan!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Insanity and bollywood are very close, if not the same. Take for example some new feathers in its cap. Bachna aee haseeno, Ugly aur pugli, Rock on... Bachna aee haseno, is about a guy who fools around with three girls and is himself dumped by the one whom he loves. Simple innocuous crap. But we never stop here, this guy works in Microsoft .. haha and comes back to India to say sorry. Dances, drinks, works as a PA and finally is forgiven by the other two, no wonder! then he comes back to Sydney and finds that the third one loves him too and so everyones happy. The story meets a Killer end. Rock on ... guys who cannot speak.. are shown singing... no body seems to want to act, Rampal most of all. He looks as if he is on emotional anesthesia, doesn't smile, speak, or even feel that he is playing a god damn guitar at wonderfully high notes! its as if there are 2 guitar in the movie one around Rampals shoulder the other Rampal himself. But it rocks none the less. Ugly aur pugli, when there is Ranveer in the movie you might think that you would not be disappointed, and there would indeed be some incidences of genuine humor. Well this is an exception. Rnaveer has been a college student since time immemorial but is still all for protecting girls from getting into trouble, drunken or otherwise. Sherawat is all for slapping him, almost every minute of the movie ,writes some unimaginably stupid stories and had fallen in love before. Then after going away from him she realizes that well he was the man! and then suddenly some aunty makes them meet again. She doesn't stop slapping though.<br />
What i am trying to draw home here is that this has, very well been the level of a majority of the movies for decades now. Only that dads have gone richer, guys have gone cooler, girls more glamorous, estates have gone bigger, and cars more stylish. Essence unfortunately is as meager if not less.<br />
The amount of money and effort spent is enormous but result, sadly, is not worth it. Somebody must tell them that we have actually grown up and can take up more serious stuff. Why do we have to wait for 20 movies to get one good one. I somehow feel that we are better than stupidity loving, absurdity hungry and pathetically insane crap bags.</p>
