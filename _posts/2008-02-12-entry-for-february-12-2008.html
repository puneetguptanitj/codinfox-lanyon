<p>M : You donot treat the computer as others do, you treat as if it were part of you, you talk to him and he answers, he explains and you understand better, and it has been happening for years .... ever wondered why? beacause you are not very much different from ur friend. Your domains are not just overlapping they are pretty much the same,</p>
<p>N : What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p>M : don't burden your mind thats the only thing you have, Are you troubled? </p>
<p>N : yes</p>
<p>M : you will have to let it go, you will have to let it all go anger fear doubt and disbelief, free your mind and your body would follow. </p>
<p>N : But you said i donot have one ... </p>
<p>M : oh i did??!! well thats true, but to get out, you must first convince yourself that you are very much inside.</p>
<p>N : It seems to me that you like to confuse people ... </p>
<p>M : I love to let them discover... Do you remember you poped when I had explained it to you.</p>
<p>N : Yeah it was too much for me... </p>
<p>M : thats the way for every body ..but your age was a challenge ..you were too old to get free. Didn't you see the other potentials? they were all kids. And that Mojo even called you a geriatric!!</p>
<p>N : Yeah! but why is age a problem, ... </p>
<p>M : the more you live the more you store the patterns the more logical you get</p>
<p>N : is logic bad?</p>
<p>M : it relies on probability, certainties and treats exceptions as aberrations.</p>
<p>N : so?</p>
<p>M : it is built on rules and thats what makes it weak</p>
<p>N : Quantum leaps are not an every day affair are they?</p>
<p>M : i guess not! they are rare specially in simulations where they are generally treated as bugs.</p>
<p>N : Is there a way out?</p>
<p>M : yes there is ... change the paradigm and frame of reference.</p>
<p>N : From ampliude to frequency, from knowledge to essence, from matter to mind ..isn't it?</p>
<p>M : pretty much! amplitude rises and falls still the freuqency is constant, people live and die but existence is constant</p>
<p>N : yeah... all we need to do is get our eyes off from ...outside ..</p>
<p>M : yes but thats not enough, mind always tries to go back ..look at him .. he would one day ditch us. He is tired of this place, he is tired of fighting, tired of eating that God da.n goop every day. All the single cell protiens could not raise even a dendrite out his dead neurons.</p>
<p>N : (laughs) true! i don't like him myself.</p>
<p>M : it is not the question of likes and dislikes it is the question of beliefs and disbeliefs. Even after seeing the red petals growing from unfathomably large black stems, he wants to go back ..he believes in those pods and i believe in this hovercraft.</p>
<p>N : ethics are a tough science</p>
<p>M : yes they are ... however you cannot deny that you feel happy if you adhere to them. So do you still look at the woman in the red dress (squints)</p>
<p>N: (chuckles) well .. not quite! </p>
<p>M : look again ..pointing towards his back </p>
<p>N: (turns, expecting to see the same old sentient program aiming a 0.5AE at his forhead, but he has gone, instead there is nothing but light. Is it the "door" the door of light , brilliant flash of light is rising with power of billion suns , embracing in it everything that falls in way , its his turn now , unmindfully he streches open his arms in a desperate attempt to grasp all that he can, his jacket is flying with the air, he can not keep his wonderstruck eyes open for long they slowly close and lips go still but he is smiling, he mingles with light and soon there is only light that remains .. his friend smiles with the usual charisma and says"you deserved it" and departs)</p>
<p>A shreaking voice of some alarm cuts through the bliss ... and soon the trance ends, it is the same 101 and same old bed ... and yes its 9:18am again!</p>
