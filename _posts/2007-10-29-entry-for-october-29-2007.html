<div style="text-align:center;"><font size="3"><strong>Why blog?!</strong></font>    </div>
<p> 
<div style="text-align:justify;">Sometimes i wonder why people like blogging. If you try and critically analyse, once someone has posted something all he is left with is a simple, though constant feeling of anticipation about how people will react to his post. Some people are generous enough to post new ideas, detailed studies and excellent excerpts on wonderful issues knowing fully well that this is rather a thankless job. Somebody might easily copy paste the material and boast it as his own, still people donot stop and keep on blogging, i feel blogging in learning, is very much similar to open source in software. Why people slog and develop something simply to have their name in some opensource project. Is it for the amount of recognition the product might bring with it. Is it a fair deal? it seems!! Also I feel while you are reading you are more patient than while you are listening, and while you are writing you are more concetrated than while talking. When you read and write just ideas, you tend to forget about the person actually and start appreciating or contemplating just the post. This shift of emphasis removes all that might have fallen in way of learning. People crticise or applaud openely. That creates a sense of resposibility for both the one who is writing a new post or for those who are adding a comment to it. This serious and deliberate effort towards understanding things and possiblity of breaking the barriers of space to find like minded people, is according to me one of the biggest drives that is propelling this blogging business so consistenetly. For people like me who get ample time and lesser company !! on weekends it has become (at least by their standards) a productive pasttime. Many a times in my job i have got problems solved because somebody blogged something that was precisely what i needed. Isn't this a great synergy developing here. Of course writing a technical blog is far tougher a call than writing a non technical one, as in the latter you can easily play around with words and make a decent output but the former requires some real good motivation and zeal. But the point is people are willing to share whatever they have learnt. For those who are still sickeningly tied to propriety crap and donot appreciate this turn of intellectual interaction or those who question the power of this meaningful exchange of ideas i would recoomend a you tube link, its a google tech talk about a blogger made author Avinash Kaushik, this might put some wisdom in their dumb ears that how sharing things can change lives. For all the propriety patrons i would advise if you can't start blogging your heart out at least donot start thinking of putting any EULAs here! else' good!!!</p>
