<p style="font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">You are different from what you are!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a difference, and a prominent one, between you and your residual self image. The mental projection of your digital self. A compliment makes you feel that you look nice,that you are a nice human being and so on... because that is how your mind takes in the input signals and reconstructs your mental image and thats how you start seeing yourself. Who allows it to do that ...you!! thats what control is all about. Thats why so many humans continue to live oblivious to ITS presence. Without marveling at ITS beauty ITS genius and yes its CONTROL. Of course there are levels of existence that the creator permits. "Work out your own miracles" by Nepolean Hill speaks of a child born without ears or any biological hearing equipment what so ever. All were upset and had taken in the negative signals and produced a mental projection that the child would be unable to hear for his entire life. His father did something different. He worked out a miracle!!! he started giving conscious positive signals to his son, reaffirming that "My child you would not be deaf, you would hear just like a normal person." The child gained 65% of hearing capabilities!!! leaving those jacked in ...agape. The doctors said that it was a rare phenomenon of bone conduction that the child ,now a successful adult, used for hearing. So much achieved by interpreting the signals in a different way. "Again Morpheus what if all that you say is utter crap .." ...."then we would fail but consider the alternative ..what if the prophecy is right what if the war gets over tonight !! isn't that worth fighting for ...!!!</p>
