<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><strong><span style="font-size:13.5pt;">Is coincidence really a matter of chance or is it a conscious choice?!</span></strong></p>
<p>   I had to pick up my Mom but I somehow ended going to a Book Store. There again I didinot want to buy anything for myself but ended up buying a book. "Self aware universe by Amit Goswami"<br />   After reading the book now I feel that there is nothing like coincidence at least not in the same semantic sense as we usually use it. Every so called "coincidence" needs millions of events actually occuring at the precise time and the precise place to let the final thing take place... everything has a purpose ... may be the butterfly effect is not that unrealistic a theory ... Any event occurring in a wrong fashion can have such cumulative effects that can trigger an utter chaos in the universe...<br />   I believe that i getting hold of this book also followed a sequence of numerous well planned events. There was some purpose behind this too....<br />   ..Indeed there was. It turned out to be the best book that I have ever read and probably would ever read. I never knew that the wide spectrum of questions starting from Quantum Paradoxes to Spirituality can be answered by a single unified theory..</p>
<p>   I could have never deduced that even the problem of choice has a backing of Quantum Physics...!!! what part we play in materializing an object thereby giving it a space time reality...<br />   If there really exists a unitive single consciousness ..what role do we play.... if the world is really a matrix how can we bend or defy the rules....!! (I am always prompted to draw analogies between whatever I see or read and the movie ..because I feel that the movie really offers that much ....)<br />   Amit Goswami has dealt with all this with such a good control and reason ... that I am prompted to say he is a perfect blend of a philosopher ..a scientist and a writer!</p>
