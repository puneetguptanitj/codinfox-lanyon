<div style="text-align:center;">NEO JONATHAN SEAGULL </div>
<p> 
<div style="text-align:justify;">Jonathan unmindful of the consequences has the reached the top and is about to dive in, to test his nerves and his love for flying. But no one has ever made the first jump!!! he crashes down the sea, water hits him like stone but hurts only his body and not his will to fly. He rises higher still, jumps again but this time not to fall but to feel a gust of air that no one in his flock had ever experienced. Intoxicated by the joy of flying he pierces through the air amidst all the wonder struck eyes of his fellow gulls. He has a problem with authority. He thinks there is something wrong with the way other gulls are living out their lives, that there is more to living than just eating and sleeping. But untill the varying minds are freed they are still part of the system and hence his enemies, he is outcast and asked to leave the flock. Then suddenly one day ... knock kncok...<br /> Hello neo!! speaks out trinity... Morpheus and trinity are the bright gulls that take neo to <font size="-1">Nebercanezzer</font>, Why are there so few of us here. "..why is it so difficult to make the gulls realise that they are actually free." That they are from wingtip to wingtip nothing but a thought, an idea of a great gull. Why oh why do they always choose the blue pill. Is it really so heard to choose the other one. But i am now going to hang up this phone and show them a world without YOU, Jonathan returns to the shore with his few students to teach the other gulls. Gulls start coming up in thousands,, a whole new zion is formed. Neo knows that he has played his part as an earthly being.... There is some other place to go now.. an astral light sky maybe. Neo turns into bright light and vanishes in thin air.<br /> Is that what you made for Neo .. oracle asks sati pointing towards the bright sun. Sati smiles and nodes. Will we ever meet neo again? sati's eyes are filled with anticipation. Indeed ... but we must learn to fly that fast first!</div>
