<div style="text-align:center;"><font size="3"><strong>Hinduism</strong></font></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Religion is the protocol that determines the flow of life. It is its duty to ensure that the flow is smooth, error free and continuous. Life in the world network exists in packets of various sizes and forms, human beings being one type of such packets. For these packets to flow properly religion provides some do's and don'ts. In absence of religion there are bound to be collisions. The idea of a sacred spiritual reality is nothing but a concept of such an ideal network where people packets do not conflict with each other at all. This wishful thinking helps in creating a commitment to follow a path that leads to a better place. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hinduism is<span>  </span>a polytheistic religion with a monotheistic soul, innumerable lords deities and goddesses ultimately converge to one bhrama. This, far from being contradictory is rather a unique feature of Hinduism. The limitless expanse of the worshiped idols in a way leaves scope for as many interpretations and as many choices for the follower. Letting him relate to the almighty in his own way. This also leaves ample scope for openness and resilience. This non absolutism helps the believer to get hold of religion at his own pace and style. Hinduism is mother of all religions not because it is special but because it does not aspire to be one. Not because it is one of its kind but because it acknowledges that there are many like it. Ocean is always full of water as it is open to every river that comes to it. Hinduism is vast because it has room for any follower that turns towards it. He need not be a fanatic or staunch believer of some commandments.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All the multifarious lords and deities converge into one almighty, then adopting a pantheistic form identifies this almighty with the universe. As an unspoken or unperceived reality. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there are various forms of offering to the lord that at the first instance seem very absurd, weird and questionable. Take the mantras for example. Why should one actually repeat a line say 108 times, why only that line or why only that many times. Mantras are nothing but sentences that if spoken properly produce vibrations that set the one who enchants them inline with the vibrations around him. The repetitions are just to make sure that you chant the mantra properly at least once!. Om tat sat "There is only one truth and that is OM" is not an abstract belief rather its a scientific reality. This simple monosyllabic word <span> </span>contains all the possible vibrations and hence all the possible waves. It therefore has everything that constitutes this universe and for this reason, is the universe itself and thus the only truth. "Any knowledge is knowledge of ignorance" is not more evident anywhere as it is in the knowledge of Hinduism. The dichotomies that one faces due to lack of <span> </span>complete knowledge are enough to unsettle even the most steadfast follower, but I think patience is well paid towards the end. According to me Hinduism is not a religion it is a way of life. It talks about the tao of power the path between the opposites. It has always advocated the path of non-extremism. In any chemical reaction the drive is to reach a state of equilibrium and greater entropy. The drive to follow Hinduism is to establish a similar equilibrium in life. It does not try and impose its philosophy in any way .. rather acknowledges importance of nature and respect in Shintoism as much as it acknowledges importance of ethics and society in Confucianism or of naturalism in Taoism. This flexibility has given it the resilience to withstand an entire eon. This acceptance of every form of human life good and bad makes it complete and forces its followers to be more tolerant. May all these life quantum one day be able to experience a collision free life network where the interplay of various protocols generate a blissful and uninterrupted flow of energy ...Amen!!</p>
