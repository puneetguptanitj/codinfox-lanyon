<div style="text-align:center;"><strong><font size="4">Does someone believe in you?!</font></strong></div>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is great to have someone who believes in you. One who believes in you so blindly that you cannot convince him otherwise! One who talks to you only about possibilities and not deadlocks. Who believes in you not because he knows you'll succeed but because he knows that you will not give up. One who regards every decision you take not because he knows that it is right but because he knows that you have done your best to come to that decision. You have looked into every possibility before coming to that decision. Who is always there to give you unconditional love. Who always has a big amount in your emotional bank account!! Who knows when you could have done better not to taunt you with that reality later on, but just to give a gentle reminder that you have scope for improvement. Who smiles, as gently when you succeed as he does, when you don't.<span>  </span>With whom you could talk about your failures with as much ease as you could talk to him about your successes. Who believes in the fact that every situation has a seed of equivalent benefit. Who always helps you find it and nurture it!! How soothing and reassuring it would be to have him around! But its really tough to find such a person ..indeed it is tough ..so.. how about being that person yourself!!!</p>
