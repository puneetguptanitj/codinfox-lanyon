<p style="text-align:justify;">Am I dead, puzzled Neo asks Morpheus. "Far from it" is the reply he gets. Why is being far from being dead an achievement, one might wonder. But pain doesn't allow him to think about anything else.Â  Every cell of his body seems to be tied to some invisible string. He can't move his hands or legs or head. He can't even open his eyes. Tied completely he lies dead still. What is this pull, these strings.. is it just gravity or is it something more. Why can't he move freely the way his thoughts are moving right now?! What binds him? Its his state, probably, its the false notion that his identity lies in holding on to his attributes. That his past deeds (functions) have altered his, originally pure, state and future moves would bring even more misery. The strings are that of anticipation, expectation and regret. Regret for the states that he has been in. Anticipation and expectation for the states that he is still to experience. So the problem is not him its this false notion and these strings. Its the deep subconscious acceptance that he "is" his state. That for having an identity you have to have something to hold on to. You cannot be a pure function, an abstraction or an idea to exist. Strings are needed to hold you together but well they also "hold" you for good. Society is the framework where these states interact but unmonitored and unsynchronized access causes the human objects to malfunction. Therefore we would have to either devise means for concurrency controls for organized access to shared resources, religions can be good starters, or become a pure abstraction a simple and powerful representation of a beautiful idea. For the first solution we require simultaneous involvement from the collective whole, for the second we require just our own consent. Its the attributes that we hold so dear that bind us and in turn cause all the plight. I therefore believe, that a "functional" existence would be a more society safe version of, otherwise unmanageable, human existence.</p>
