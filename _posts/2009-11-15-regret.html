<p style="text-align:center;">i turned back in the cloudless night</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">i stood there mum ,  with tears blocking my sight</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">as i carried with me an unbearable load</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">all i found was an empty road,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">the load of unkept promises it was</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">of unfinished tasks and an unworthy cause</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">of the aims that were set but were hardly met</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">now a barren land holding seeds of regret</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">in the labarynth of the path that i had taken</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">i saw those turns where i had forsaken</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">my goal, through those hasty wrong choices</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">which had subdued myself and stifled my inner voices</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">now i stand with repentence filling my eyes</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">knowing fully well that god didn't play any dice</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">it was i who knowingly went astray</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">even when, from the right path i was,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">just a step too far, only a moment away.﻿</p>
