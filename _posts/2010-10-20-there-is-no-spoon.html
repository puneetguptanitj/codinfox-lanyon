P: There is no spoon<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">Reality  is formed, sustained and experienced by perception. Its a tangled  hierarchy. Which I believe is the corner stone of any wonderfully complex system such as this world. Parts must sum up to form parts that  can be combined to form even bigger whole. Its identical to concept of  pairs in Lisp. If a pair can be an element of another pair. No data  structure, howsoever complex it be, is beyond reach. Subject and object  is one such pair. Perceiver and perceived are inherently tied. I saw a  ted video recently, swami dayanand saraswati said, if u fake it long  enough and hard enough, u make it. It is so true for courage,  enthusiasm, and even being!. A persistent change in perception is bound  to materialize into reality. A change in reality almost certainly  changes perception. Fate therefore is a matter of choice. Choice a  result of events. “There is no spoon” says the other potential even when  Neo is holding one in his hands. There is a suggestion of surrender  here, which can be elevated to transcending or degraded to succumbing.  Why should we reject something that feels real, for something out there.  Why should be bother about the veracity of reality anyway, just relax  ..shouldn’t we. The reason I guess lies in the closure property of the  world. We are the world just as much as we are part of it. In this  journey we meet Oracles, and Morpheuses and Smiths and Cyphers. We join  the believers and fight the sentinels. We make a free choice or let  ourselves be guided by fate. Until in the end we realize, we are  fighting with ourselves. and that the battle ends only by, and instantly  after, a voluntary surrender which then shapes a whole new reality with  we being the center of the 10,000 things like everyone else. In this  attempt to dig deeper into this reality we are,  probably silently but  earnestly, wishing to find ourselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">So deep, goes the rabbit hole<br />
but so does my mind, my heart, my soul,<br />
oneday I would reach the end and see,<br />
i was always the one, all were always, one with me</p>
