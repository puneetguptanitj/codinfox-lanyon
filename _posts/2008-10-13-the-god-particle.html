<p style="text-align:justify;">From atom to electron, protons and neutron, to quarks and finally to strings ... increasing depth of human reach. And increasing hope of understanding God's mind. String is to matter as alphabet is to language. Both are fundamental and there cannot be anything deeper than them. What is a string made up of with respect to matter, is just as demanding a question as, what's an alphabet made up of, with respect to language. With the given frame and reason for investigation these represent the respective ultimate limits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is striking though is the absolute absence of symmetry in a world which is made up of identical constituents. Why is it that no direction of sight fetches the same result as some other direction. The reason I would say, if I am any judge, lies in the infinite ways in which these identical building blocks can be grouped.So versatile picture comes not because of similar ingredients but highly spread out continuum of recipes!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Recipes are what we see, ingredients are as far we can get. But who on god's! earth groups them together. Who asks a certain energy filament to vibrate at such and such note, to be with such and such comrade! Who prepares the world as complex as ours, with things as simple as strings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hadron Particle accelerator aims to crash two proton streams together in order to create that absolute symmetry in the form of shower of sub atomic particles and probably find out who comes out of the blue and gives birth to matter and consequent diversity. Finding a graviton leave our universe and enter some other is of course another important reason. Richard Greene talks about it in Elegant Universe with simplicity and elegance. However with eyes having lenses only of fascination I can only get amazed and seldom follow completely. None the less the idea is beautiful, and if physics is toned down to beauty, it can lie in an lay beholders eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we can give any name to one who brings things together and holds them that way. We can as well call him God. He is the one who is definitely there but is definitely not there. He is the wonderful unifying commonality. We would never be able to find him in content as its the essence where he chooses to be.</p>
