<p style="text-align:left;">Dear America,</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Sub: In search of identity</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I wanted to talk to you about my life spent on your soil for the past 150 tireless rotations of mother earth. Speaking of rotations, it has been a whirlpool of activities for me as well, though not as rapid as 470m/sec, but significant.  More than a mere stay, it has been an experience. Despite my fervent adherence to my roots and values, I have to acknowledge (applaud rather) the wonderful blend of individual and society that you have created. Self dependence and duty seem to be the fountainhead of all excellence visible here. Your patience  towards all the nationality streams pouring into your diverse whole is unbelievable. So often do we accuse you of being indifferent to (and even being prejudiced against) non-Americans , but whenever I see people around me I am forced to convince myself that, thats a lot of immigrants (potential or otherwise!). And therefore your sporadic outbursts are even justified at times. Though I appreciate your unswerving determination towards building a just society out of this mess! i would like to comment on the situation from my angle (which might be a new one)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To give you a small example, when i was in india i used to watch Russell Peters shows and used to laugh like crazy, but the moment I came here those very same jokes started haunting me. Indeed we have a funny accent, indeed we smell like curry!, indeed we dress up in the most bizarre ways, indeed we are cheap. These weren't jokes anymore. What you must realise that, though it might at times get frustrating for you to deal with so many non-citizens and their needs and welfare, what you might as well look at is the sea change these people go through. It is not easy, for us as well. Now, I do not, for one moment, want to hint here, that we are doing a favor to you by overcoming that huge gulf. I simply want to put forth the dilemma in which we are. Some people try to forget their past and mix completely with natives (at least they try to do so), some others are just unable to let go their own cultures and decide to remain "odd", while the rest end up being somewhere in the middle. The third kind, is the most prevalent of all, and these are the people who are facing a daily tussle of doing just about anything the american way or their own way. Striking a balance between cultures is not something you can do effortlessly. Being their original selves in their apartments and somewhat native-ish outside, is what most of these third kind of people settle for. Next major concern, is the killing conversion rate, most of the people coming to US (especially students) used to work before coming here and most probably were enjoying their self dependence, earning enough for themselves,family, friends and parties. Suddenly they have to ask for money and that too bloated by a factor of 50, thats not so easy to swallow. So we are always on a watch out for free food and clothes and furniture, thats how we get wired within a few months. Is it decent, definitely not, is it always needed probably not. But it happens.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sure we seem to take a lot from you than offer you back. Overcoming the turmoil of identity crises we do, however, try to do our best in measuring up to the American standards of higher education. We do enjoy the classes, the atmosphere which is free from constraining hierarchies. We do give our intellect to make the classes more ripe with diverse ideas. Thats what we share generously, and thats not something small either.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We participate and enjoy competition and contribute via our knowledge and services. We fill labs with not just accent or curry but also genuine effort. For which we are proud. Soon we would tread are own paths to our own destinations. Until then I wish your patience and our endeavor would find their way through barriers of racial stereotypes and prejudices.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Yours intellectually,<br />
