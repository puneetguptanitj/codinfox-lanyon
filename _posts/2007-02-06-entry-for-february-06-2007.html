<div style="text-align:center;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="5"><strong>We see what we choose to see!!</strong></font></div>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">What are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets.....No neo I am trying to tell you that when you are ready you won't have to...!!</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Neo lies dead after his chest is ruthlessly pierced through by 0.5Action Express bullets triggered from the Desert Eagle air suspension guns. These guns are manufactured by Magnum Research of America and are said to be the toughest guns as per the payload they can carry and also the huge recoil they generate ...0.5AE is amongst the heaviest payloads.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Still he gets up and stands straight...his simple â€˜no' stops all the bullets aimed at him!! He didn't have to dodge them!! He was ready ...!!!</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Can something as simple as a conscious choice generate such unbelievable results ... can the quantum mind collapse the wave functions in such a manner!! Can the stored patterns be ruled out to this extent...Richard Bach says that at every point of decision we choose one from the many parallel lives ..Amit Goswami says we choose or bring to classical state one of the many parallel quantum universes...</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We are inescapably involved in bringing about that which seems to be happening!!</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Have you ever wondered that when somebody tries to explain something to us and we find it difficult to follow ...we often say "can you give an example". What is so special about an example which is absent in logical deductions ...why when the person gives an example something clicks somewhere and we shout Eureka!!!<span> </span>(what happens is essentially a non local phenomenon ..we instantaneously understand... it is not a step by step deduction)<span> </span>still we remain unaware of the fact that what we just witnessed was a small quantum leap ..a small encounter with the creativity that lies in any non local phenonmeon ...that we just touched our quantum selves....</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"></font></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">If the slight glimpse of this unexplored territory gives us the Aha!! experience ..imagine staying there!!!</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"></font></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Oh course the ride to the territory would not be easy ....i mean ..</font></p>
