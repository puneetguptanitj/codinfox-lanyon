<p style="text-align:justify;">That is neverland, James whispers in Silvia's ears who is smiling with wet eyes. Dying but calm. She finally walks with a sense of pain and peace to the final abode. Neverland is allegedly a place that we all seek. In every corner of our room, every turn of the roads in every relationship we silently pray to get a glimpse of a land where happiness is rampant. Where there is serenity and bliss. Where joy is in plenty and worries are none. Even if we aren't lucky enough to see it, we always are willing to harbor this hope, of the possiblity of existance of such a place. Even that humble desire is strong enough to let us shrug off few of our troubles and relax our over stressed selves. Then finally as we return to the place where we were, we are met again by all the grudges, pace and panic that we had left behind on our way to Neverland. We are sad again. Shouting on others, not forgiving ourselves either. Pathetically idle but pretending to be busy or terribly busy but pretending to enjoy the life. Chaos might be the new order or order might have gone too chaotic, but we find ourselves out of place in both. Something is missing we say to ourselves and then fall mum. That quest of ,unknown but sure to be beautiful abode, makes the present one appear even more dismal. The abject state of things here only amplifies the longing for Neverland.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">James however not only builds a neverland for Silvia he seems to always reside in one as well. The way children indulge him, the way he flies a kite or plays chess while working on his, soon to be a hit, play makes the viewer ponder. Isn't that worthy of a neverland. Shouldn't his muse be just as blissful. As he watches the children play he pictures them as flying. As he and his wife both enter into separate rooms James seem to enter into a different world altogether. He corrects Peter when he uses the word "just". For James "just:" is a horrible candle stifling world. It kills not just the flame but also the light that it could have brought. His play ends with an urge to the audience to believe in fairies. Urges them to dream and keep alive the irrepressible spirit of youth. So that no one ever throws off a diamond saying its just a rock, or rejects an idea saying its just a dream. Because as it turns out the difference between our current place to the much sought for destination might very well be, that one dream. No matter how wonderful the neverland be, we must immerse in and enjoy fully our nevertheless land.<br />
