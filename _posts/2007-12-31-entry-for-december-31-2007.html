<div style="text-align:center;"><font size="3">Absence &gt; Presence</font></p></div>
<p>   He is no more cries the son, relatives fall on their knees heads droop down, some eyes go watery while few others get dried up for ever. Some ask for forgiveness for whatever wrong they had done to him, while some resolve to live the way he wanted them to live. People feel empty and lost and peep through the window to see the body one last time. An emotional vacuum is created and feelings driven by an invisible force pour in from all sides in an attempt to fill it. Quintessence is a similar force that the cosmologists believe is pulling the galaxies apart, it is vacuum energy! Ever wondered why on opening the valve of the vacuum tube matter gushed in! why is matter so meek infront of its absence. Mind experiences a similar energy, in absence of thoughts, when it comes closer to this cosmological energy when it comes closer to vacuum. Vacuum is not nothing it is everything, something containing matter and antimatter in exact proportions and yes tremendous energy. Absence is more powerful than presence because absence is pure emotions! it is pure feelings! it is unmanifested untarnished undwindling and undeniable presence! Let the heart crave for nothing, let the hands reach out for nothing let the mind be fixed on nothing and then see what everything is all about!!</div>
