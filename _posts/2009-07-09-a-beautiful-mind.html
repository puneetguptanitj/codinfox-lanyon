<p style="text-align:center;">In the silence of solitude<br />
rescued from the multitude</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">In the absence of activity<br />
safe from chaos, free from world's captivity</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">there lies an innocent awestruck mind<br />
pious and clean, one of its kind</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">a mind that is desperate only to create<br />
unaware of rote learning or a craving to imitate</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">a mind that is fertile and able to invent<br />
a mind u can not fool, elude or circumvent</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">a mind that builds only for building's sake<br />
willing to share, putting nothing on stake</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">a mind that is clear and wants to contribute<br />
that detests hoarding, and is ready to distribute</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">a mind that knows, not of limitations<br />
that enjoys every journey, never yearningÂ  for culminations</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">a mind with which, we were all equally blessed<br />
a fact long forgotten, simply left unaddressed</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">there is a constant longing that makes us feel,<br />
a lingering emptiness which is sapping away your zeal</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">if we ever wish, to go back to the source,<br />
we'll have to regain this mind, whatever be the course,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">no matter what our fate in this world be,<br />
to be able to create, is what it really means to be free.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p>
