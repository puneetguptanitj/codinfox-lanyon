<p style="text-align:justify;" dir="ltr">I always thought that abstraction is a very useful, sometimes even indispensable, tool. It lets you control complexity, lets you build something bigger without getting overwhelmed with deluge of similar sets of details everytime. I treated it as a means to let rate of creation catch up with speed of imagination. However after having watched few minutes of a very interesting documentary something struck me.. perhaps the world of abstraction isn’t that blissful. Rather might be plagued with something quite detrimental.. over simplification. Does confining human expression to 26 characters ring a bell? is abstraction in language science and any other field over quantizing human interactions and perhaps even existence? there are uncountable numbers between two integers, there are infinite sounds between two syllables.. Aren’t we missing diversity of nature by this over generalization. This compartmentalization extends not just to means of expression but also to ways of life.. Suddenly getting decent education, good job and a house, a car and a pet friendly family have become more than enough data points to characterize a good life. Since when did “lived happily ever after” became more than enough information to describe a nice end. Aren’t we missing something by overlooking the nuances, by being less appreciative of variations. Since when did a burger, fries and a drink became a meal?! a pet and couple became a family?! where did we lose the richness of life to abundance of monotonicity. Why are we afraid of details, why have we become less appreciative of the complete spectrum, and decided on the contrary to pick only few bits and pieces which we find manageable? the more we think about it the more we start to feel that we are becoming part this huge assembly line of industrial life. In the name of efficiency we have delegated creativity as well and reduced ourselves to just passive consumers. If its necessary to draw boundaries of abstraction, sometimes its as important to cross them. If god is in details.. this oversimplification of existence appears to be a devil’s work.Let not dogmas dictate the reach of perception, let not self drawn periphery decide the extent of thoughts, let not subtleties be subdued and monotonicity triumph..</p>
