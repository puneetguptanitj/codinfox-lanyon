<p style="text-align:justify;">During one of my sporadic attempts to read philosophy, I stumbled upon Leibniz interpretation by Rodger Scruton. I was struck by the idea of monads and predefined harmony. Leibniz argues that the entire creation is objective. Frame of reference or observer does not impact existence. The world is as it is. Not as it is observed, making interactions between objects nothing but a byproduct of hidden preexisting harmony. This makes each of us monads fully functional quantum of creation like any other. The possibility of so much autonomy and independence amidst the seeming interdependent coexistence is overwhelming to say the least. First natural reaction to such an analysis is of refusal. But what we cannot ignore is the widespread harmony in nature. How the Sun rises at just the right time. Flowers blossom exactly when they should, tides occur ever so effortlessly. This spontaneous flow of events does indicate an external synchronization, rhythm and yes harmony.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Harmony by definition is pleasing combination of parts in a whole. Interestingly it doesn’t entail for parts to change, only combine specifically. If we agree to Leibniz analysis, being pleasant should also be just as predefined and absolute as is harmony. Even in Plato’s eyes, harmony had a special place. For him justice lied in harmony. So much so that a disharmonious state was unjust. In music, notes that in themselves might sound shrill and loud when combined in a certain manner can produce most pleasant of songs. Notes don’t need to be altered, just juxtaposed nicely. Nature in itself is a harmonious interplay of every element of creation. It also responds differently to harmony. Water (80% of creation) for example crystalizes in beautiful symmetric structures when exposed to harmonious sounds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Harmony’s existence is undeniable, its importance massive and its earnest pursuit vital. Harmonious combination of parts doesn’t have extremes, is symmetric and unobstructed, makes the whole all absorbing and accepting. That’s why perhaps disharmonious state becomes discriminating and unjust. Disharmonious thoughts become obstructive and non-accepting and hence laden with prejudice. Disharmonious relationships witness frequent extremes and eventually give way to such exhaustion. Harmony in contrast radiates beauty, peace and happiness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus being a monad is perhaps not that bland, purposeless and lonely after all. In tuned with the universal rhythm, unbridled by bondage and forces of interactions we (equipped with immense autonomy and completeness) are free rather to blissfully follow a harmonious course.</p>
