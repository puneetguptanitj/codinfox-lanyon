<div style="text-align:center;"><strong><font size="4">Men of Steel</font> </strong></div></p>
<p style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;">No one expects us to win, but if we do against all odds, we make history! : Sunil Bharti Mittal</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;"> </div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I finished this book few weeks ago, before starting the book I skimmed through the pages, I was awed to read through the names of Men this book was to talk about. I felt that the book had a befitting title, however, after reading the book I felt even the strong tittle as this was an understatement! What lay in those 100 pages, were not mere simple life stories of the few business icons, they were the stories of struggle of those who won because they did not give themselves any other option. Be it a 28 year old son who was given the charge of a business empire of 8000 crore after his father's demise. Who not only had to overcome the trauma of such a huge loss but also had to carry forward the legacy of his father. Who was looked with skepticism by all who revered his father, who had to take radical steps to keep up to the changing times. Who not only proved critiques wrong, but also proved worthy of the trust his father always had in him. Kumar Birla as the world knows him has expanded his father's empire to an astounding magnitude of 34000 crore and.. oh yes he is just 38, so best is yet to come I guess!!. However not everyone gets a established system to grow rather they themselves frame one and take it to such heights that leaves even their competitors wondering!! Subhash Chandra whose family now has a total worth of 5000 crore started his entrepreneurship when he was 17 and did not have any penny to his name, his family business had failed, they were bankrupt. He diversified his business from grain trading to Essel Packaging to Zee TV. Not that he won every battle, Rupert Murdoch episode and the competition given by STAR channel has been significant, but the point is he has continued to moved forward undeterred by such detours.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Be it Rajeev Chandreshekhar a Silicon Valley techie freak! Who came back to India and set in motion the telcom revolution and finally sold BPL to Essar for $1.2 billion, or Nasli Wadia who went against his own father under guidance of JRD Tata to revive his family business of Bombay Dyeing and diversified it by purchasing Britania,or be it Bikki Oberoi who has transformed his surname into a synonym of luxury. Or one of the most flamboyant businessman of his times Vijay Mallay. Or Nandan Nilekani whose ideas have shaped the IT trend of our country and have made Infosys an IT giant. They opted to go against the tide, not because they were forced to do so but because thats the way they work! These men have given Indian industry the cutting edge, with deals of close to $18billion in less than 30 days, our exponential growth rate seems to prove that we are indeed,  all set to make history!!</p>
