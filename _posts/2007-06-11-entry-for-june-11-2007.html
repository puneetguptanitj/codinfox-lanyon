<p style="font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">Why Mr. Anderson why do u fight why do u rise and strike back ,,why again   </p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">...because i chose it so!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jesus resurrected and came to life again to bless his apostles, all bowed but for one ... Thomas.. he became skeptic and wanted to confirm that He indeed was Christ who was nailed to the cross, He went forth to feel the stigmata and yes ! He was the same reverend Lord son of the almighty ..he had suffered for the whole humanity and had come to teach them a lesson of love!A doubting thomas is one who refuses to believe anything unless he has confirmed it on the basis of some empirical proofs... Thomas A Anderson .. gets this name for the same attitude of his. He knows something, what he knows he can't explain but it is there, like a splinter in his mind, driving him mad. He has a look in his eyes of a man who is expecting to wake up from a dream... that expectation is the commencement of the quest for the holy grail, the path where the human soul says yes to resistance and no to compliance, when a force that lied deep inside explodes out all of a sudden and draws its hands forth to stop the sentinels!!, when the eyes watchful search for the WHY! But ironically there is no end to this resistance ... it dwells upon itself ... with each act of saying no giving rise to greater resistance. Even after having the eyes of the oracle Smith doesnot know why Mr. Anderson can't stop fighting... why can't he just quit!!! that is the quintessence of this path if u r on it, u cannot stop fighting ..... resistance ends with the exit from garden. When after resistance the soul finds that there is no difference between itself and the one with whom it is fighting, when it chooses the way of power .. the path between the opposites the path between resistance and compliance ..the path of acceptance. Smith unmindful of this, hacks Neo, oblivious to the fact that when differences vanish nothing exists and nothing ceases to exist  ... nothing remains relative! Only absolute  persists , yin-yang get removed only a clear continuum remains!</p>
