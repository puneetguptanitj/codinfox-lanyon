<div style="text-align:center;"><font size="3"><strong>ITS STRENGTH OF THE WINGS THAT WE SEEK</strong></font></p>
<p>Now the road ahead is to be walked alone,<br />      There is no time to weep or morn,<br /> Failures and successes are to be kept aside<br />      Walk with strength as what matters is the ride</p>
<p> Lots of people have lost and won<br />      Tasks have been finished and some are still left undone<br /> Its not the pace of walk thats needed to be high<br />      whats needed is that you face detours but still donot return a sigh,</p>
<p> Walking alone would never be easy,<br />      It would be tougher when path would be hazy,<br /> You would miss the aegis that had protected you for so long,<br />      but i guess its time to unbelong,</p>
<p> It doesn't mean you are leaving your roots,<br />      rather, you are giving them strength to nourish better fruits,<br /> Chrysalis is hard because it is not meant to be weak,<br />      as its not an easier path but strength of wings that we seek,</div>
