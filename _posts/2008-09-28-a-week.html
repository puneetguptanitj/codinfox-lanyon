<p style="text-align:justify;">Clock strikes 10, we drive our way back home, after a 5 day long week of almost 12-13 hrs a day, we have all the right to be tired and feel somewhat accomplished despite the ticket count in our task queue. Some sleep, some watch movies ..and some..of course!! But then slowly silence looms large, for 2 days. The place, thats your home, is far too quite and peaceful, it takes few hours to adjust to it then slowly those who live alone realize that they will not be talking to very many people for next around 40 hours to come. Well thats not kinda cool! Then suddenly right part of brain compartment starts nagging, desperate to take you out of blocks, flow control, exceptions, bugs, deadlines. You shout ..all right what do you want? piece of paper maybe, he says.. you take out one and start writing, well you are baffled to see how your reluctance gets transformed, and rather quickly, to acceptance and words start flowing in. Once something useful comes up .. u hear yourself saying wow! Now what was scarcity of talks and activity moulds into spell of loneliness, things and people start taking a backseat and something else start taking a center stage. It is creativity that shows few glimpses. And of course going away from the normal track for a while is particularly refreshing. Amidst all this, there are indeed hours where you feel terribly drained out of energy and feel hopelessly bored, but I guess that is the price one has to pay for whatever fruitful one does in the span of those 48 hours. Slowly Sunday sun sets and again the memories of JIRA or DDTS start haunting back. Voidness during last few hours of that day is very peculiar in nature, u try to do something good and try to feel the same but it does not work. All that rules your thoughts now, is that here comes another set of 60hrs. You wake up next morning, try to hold onto the spell by lethargy but then left brain comes thumping in .. trying to explain that it is these 60hrs that give meaning to the next 2 days that follow. All right .. you admit. Slowly you are awake long after you woke up, to lose yourself in the crowd, to fill yourself with code and to start the melodrama all over again.</p>
