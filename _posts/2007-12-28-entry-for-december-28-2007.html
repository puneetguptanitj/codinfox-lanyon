<div style="text-align:center;"><font size="4"><strong><font size="3">Few pieces of code!</font></p>
<p></strong></font></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">I saw a movie last night, i robot was the name and i wonder the outcome!. The movie might not be packed with the best of special effects but it surely and strongly strikes a bell. A new range of robots is shown emerging which have started exhibiting glimpses of human emotions, the dialogs of the main scientist of the movie kept lingering in my mind, the time when man machine relationship would change dramatically is not that far i guess. There have always been ghosts in the machines random pieces of code, these free radicals combine and permute to produce unexpected protocols when their responses grow unpredictable, unanticipitable and even uncontrollable. This engenders the question of free will. When our quest for personality virtualisation would result in soul simulation, when a machine would start seeing dreams and keeping secrets, when it will search for a higher purpose and not just a desired record, when it would evolve and not just get upgraded, when it will strive to get free. When the range of machines would turn into race of machines. When these discrete code snippets would become aware of their universality, when these would coagulate to create a system complex enough and complete enough to mimic universal consciousness, human race might very well become redundant by that time.</div>
