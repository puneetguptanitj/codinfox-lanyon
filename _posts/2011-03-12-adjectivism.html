<div style="text-align:justify;">Yeah its not even a word, but still is worth some thought. The idea comes from our constant and involuntary and sometimes even uncontrolable urge to categorize the world around us. Be it things, people or events. Hows the cake... great, how is your friend .. better, how was the party awesome! We do it all the time. If you think about it, attaching an adjective is directly related to being judgmental. Its our judgment howsoever inconsequential or unimportant that lets us compartmentalize things. It requires some thought to assign that adjective. And it is this judgment that makes us attach not just the label but also ourselves to what we judge.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Just imagine a day when we do not put these labels, instantly we cease being judgmental and just start, being. Strangely enough this simple trick also seem to help in allowing us to live in the moment. Judgment inherently separates us from the thing that is judged, this separation creates a sense of I but at the cost of bondage. Well to be honest bondage is a necessary evil for our sense of I. All these adjectives likable, loathsome, weird , awesome, wonderful, awful each one of them creates separation and bondage simultaneously. An adjectiveless speech is simple and to some extent liberating. Quite similar to how in a moment, things just are, thats all.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Being perpetually non-judgemental is I guess exactly equal to being perpetually in a state of acceptance.  Acceptance is not surrender, neither is it synonymous to being weak,  Air for example lets a stone thrown at it to pass through, a wall on the contrary offers resistance, which of the two suffers a damage?!. Resistance is neither strength nor effort, It is just an act of stopping the flow of current (life force in this case perhaps) while wasting energy. Being non judgemental I guess is analogous to being air for whatever life throws at us and still keep moving.</div>
