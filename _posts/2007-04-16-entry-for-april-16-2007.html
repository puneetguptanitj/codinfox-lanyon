<p style="font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">Most people are other people: Oscar Wilde</p>
<p align="justify">Well do not be perturbed as like many reading this, the one who wrote it, is also a good contender in support of this saying!! If we try and delve are aims we would find most of them are nothing but imitations, few of us want to be as rich as somebody else while some might want to be as intelligent as somebody else while few others might want or aim to be as honest as someone else!! Till the point it helps in making ourselves better its good, but after a certain limit, which ironically is often crossed, we end up into an identity crises we just lose touch of what we actually are, what we turn ourselves into is nothing but a collection of pretenses out of which we choose one as per the situation demands.</p>
<p align="justify">The only criteria we seem to left with to judge ourselves is to compare and evaluate our achievements with that of others. It is a good method to improve but grossly wrong to identify ourselves as a success or failure. We might be far ahead of others and still might have failed and we might be far behind but still might have been a success. This notion looks deceptive to most of us, as it sets forth an altogether different paradigm to see success or failure, but at the end of the day success is better measured on the scale of satisfaction than on the scale of achievements. For the simple reason that satisfaction is more to do with competition with ourselves than with others. Of course satisfaction so discussed has to be genuine and not be mistaken with complacency which is lethargy in disguise of satisfaction. When we try more to be ahead of ourselves than to be closer to those who are ahead of us. When we look towards others not to run faster to beat them but to reassure ourselves that we can be there too.  </p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Its only when we have our own aims and we pursue them in our own way,</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"> </div>
<p style="text-align:center;">that we live life of our own  and not under someone else's sway</p>
