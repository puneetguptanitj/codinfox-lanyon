<p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;"><font size="3">Let the music play</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Human ear accepts and interprets any signal that falls in the range of 20Hz to 20KHz. A fact that's well know<span>  </span>but very rarely pondered over. Don't you think that this is too broad a range. We have FM channels like 102.4 , 98.3 and many such closely packed channels. This means that human radio has been purposely made capable to tune into tens of thousands of such channels. We hear and decipher simple chirping of sparrows and also the frightening thunder. Most prominent signals that we come in touch of are those that lie in this range. But this seems contradictory. If concentration is the way to empower our mind why would god befuddle us by so many sounds. The fun part in this seemingly unbalanced equation comes, <span> </span>when we start using our ears as our sense of touch! When we start feeling the presence of an object not by touching them but by hearing the obvious though feeble music. All of a sudden concentration grows. Rather than getting perturbed by the various sounds we start appreciating the slight nuances in these waves and they suddenly start to mingle up perfectly forming a rhythmic continuum. There appears to be a harmony in even a smallest tinge of wave. Every object seems to have a distinctive sound. By the way nothing is inanimate, if that is ur concern. And this was proved empirically by our own indian scientist( JC Bose) that even an iron rod lives and dies. So indeed this simple music of creation is vast and diverse spanning across loads of frequency bars. A simple act of closing ours eyes and opening our ears opens up a new vista of perception. It is for this music that the human ear was made open to such large range of vibrations. Beauty of creation lies not just in colours but also in this music. So next time you hear a sound you might imagine and appreciate the enormous interplay of nature quantum that would have generated that sound, and yeah the literal meaning of soul is Vibration. Thus we are not just the receivers of this music we are an integral part of nature's orchestra. So.. just let the music play ...!!!</p>
