<p dir="ltr">from the fire to the stone, to the moon to the clone</p>
<p dir="ltr">from the terror to the drone, then to the money to the loan</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>they changed the rules and rigged the game</p>
<p dir="ltr">they’ve made it sure, world would never be the same</p>
<p dir="ltr">they’ve implanted in us the idea of freedom</p>
<p dir="ltr">the idea of fun, and also that of boredom</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">they told us whats joy, and whats rightfully sorrow</p>
<p dir="ltr">what we would be owning, and what we’ll have to borrow</p>
<p dir="ltr">with consumption comes dependence they knew</p>
<p dir="ltr">production is so owned by those fortunate few</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">with greed for power reaching new levels</p>
<p dir="ltr">with freedoms being subdued and people reduced to pebbles</p>
<p dir="ltr">just what is free what is part of this control</p>
<p dir="ltr">what is my part, what is part of this whole</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">having fallen into a rut, we don’t seem to notice, nor do we seem to bother</p>
<p>perhaps this utter chaos is in fact the new world order</p>
