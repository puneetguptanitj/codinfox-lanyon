<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Georgia,Helvetica;"><font size="3"><strong>Any perfect creation is essentially a perfect blend of opposites</strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;font-family:Georgia,Helvetica;">
<p style="text-align:justify;font-family:Georgia,Helvetica;">Morpheus: "Unbelievable isn't it?"</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;font-family:Georgia,Helvetica;">Neo: Yes.... God!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;font-family:Georgia,Helvetica;">Trinity: <span> </span>.."What?"</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;font-family:Georgia,Helvetica;">I used to eat there! Really good noodles. I have these memories from my life none of them happened, what does that mean.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;font-family:Georgia,Helvetica;">The Matrix cannot tell u who you are ...</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;font-family:Georgia,Helvetica;">...But an Oracle can??,,...</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;font-family:Georgia,Helvetica;">
<p style="text-align:justify;font-family:Georgia,Helvetica;">That's DIFFERENT.... Oracle is also a program but it's programmed in a different way. It is designed to help the people get unplugged. It is programmed to guide those who wish to get free... she is programmed to create chaos. Why would the creator want that? "The first matrix was designed to be a perfect human world, where none suffered, where everyone would be happy. It was a disaster!!!" Creator created an oracle because all the systems that are guided only by parameters of perfection, essentially fail. Because a creation is perfect only when there is as much chaos as there is order. Only then everything gets its meaning, from its opposite. After the first version the creator understood that for matrix to be successful he has to program chaos as well. Oracle is the one who gives prophecies, who leads those who wish to be lead to the tao of power. But she leaves them at the door with the choice of walking through it or not. Had she been programmed to also help them walk .. then again there would have been too much of order and the path of power would have lost its meaning and significance. It's the randomness guided by uncertainties that adds flavour to the whole broth. Take the novel the fountainhead for example, Roark is the architect while Dominque has a fancy for crossing the boundaries. Both of them are streams of massive force but flow in opposite directions. And HENCE blend together impeccably. Both give meaning to each BECAUSE both are absolute opposites. And that is why the novel appears to be so complete. We feel we've lived a complete day when it had everything stress, laughter, tensions and relief. Anything that looks complete is always a complete amalgamation of opposites. So do not try and silent the oracle inside you, it was made to digress you from the current path so that you get to the right one. Donot let structure and order enter your life so much that you miss half of the creation. Let not order override ur vision so much that you see only half of the world and miss to appreciate the other. In words of Jagdish Chandra Bose "It is often forgotten that he who has surrounded us with this ever evolving mystery of creation has also implanted in us the desire to question and understand." This agitation and mental chaos also has its purpose.</p>
