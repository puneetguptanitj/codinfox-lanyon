<p style="text-align:justify;">"Moral: of, pertaining to, or concerned with the principles or rules of right conduct or the distinction between right and wrong; ethical."<br />
Morality is a tough science, i call it a science because it has, similar to any science, propositions, rules and defined boundaries. In the age of technology of terminators and irobots, I wonder whether there is space enough between the hurriedly moving metal parts to squeeze in  some morality2.0. Having imagined enough about mankind being subdued by machines, I guess, its high time to consider earnestly the possibility of coexistence rather than keeping charged EMP as the only way to interact. Neutralization of the other side has been the motto of humans/machines in any of the sci fi movies. Sunny becomes dear only after it helps us to take the city back and beleaguer the rest of NS5s. A Mohammad with a metal exoskeleton, if u will.<br />
Battle has always been the center stage in all of these movies. Cooperation, if any, lasts only for a few quarters of the first hour. However this book ("terminator and philosophy") talks about the possibility of sharing this space, as the only hope to future .  Prejudice is the same, if its in our minds or runs through the code in the matrix or is embedded as a firmware in read only cyberorgs cpus. It never helps irrespective of the place where it resides. Can there be a future with machines having rights similar to humans and vice-versa, we oil the machines and they work for our transportation, we take care of not unplugging them on purpose, they keep giving us copper tops. If there is any chance of such a future i would not mind risking a war for keeping this hope alive. Oracle played a nasty trick on the creator and brought into place, coexistence of machines and humans, which was a fare deal even though we lost Neo.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now what was the morality talk all about, well it was to make us believe that we are not special, and standing shoulder to shoulder to machines would not in any way be demeaning. Because as far as morality is concerned (a very special human trait) machines are better suited to outperform humans, when it comes to follow a set of rules. Humans who are often impelled by their instincts and emotions (irrationality) to cross the moral bulwarks and create a chaos (something exceptionally dear  to humans) . To be honest when it comes to morals we stand no chance against machines, their objectivity and adherence to aims and targets is unquestionable. Their insistence towards being loyal, is extremely reassuring, which might force any body to pick them as the next generation of humans. To err is human but not machines! Sarah Conner watches her son play with a machine and understands that when it comes to being human it is a machine that measures up the best.<br />
Morality then is not in the neural network of undecipherably complicated circuitry but it is the unswerving commitment to ones principles and duties towards common good and towards the creator. Its in reasoning objectively and not being digressed by the undercurrents of emotions. Being able to stay clam, and fearless till one performs ones function to the best of ones capacity. Well if these are the things that define morality, "Machines appear to be the sanest choice in this insane world".</p>
