<div style="text-align:center;"><font size="3"><strong>Deadly Comfort Zone</strong></font></p></div>
<p>During my small tenure in the software industry i have come to a frightening conclusion. That most of the industry and its people ofcourse, work in a zone which i prefer to call, with some meaningful irony, as The Deadly Comfort zone. Since the day of inception of any project till its delivery there occurs a continuous fall in learning and parallel rise in drudgery. Focus shifts from learning new things to doing old ones in more efficient way(which might however involve some learning but that certainly is not enough). That is why companies place an upper level on experience as well, while announcing the requirements for a particular post. Because what they fear is that people who are too much tuned into requirement and implementation cycles fail to recognize potential avenues for independent and different thinking. All that matters to them is release dates and weekends! Why should we learn if the industry does not seem to demand it?! well it is only because of learning curves of few at the top that the industry has been able to sustain such colossal number of programmers and have been able to cater to the needs of all. Indeed there is never an immediate need for perfection nor can it ever be fulfilled, but what can never be ignored is that we all feel an emptiness when it comes to indepth knowledge of even our own projects, forget about the technology at large. Haven't we all found, with astonishing unanimity, small closets within our domains from where we can not dare to look out. Haven't we been trying to put cloaks of specialization on dreadful reality of insufficiency. Haven't we all forgotten how we used to study during our college days with 6 subjects 6 months and 18 tests. What we have been doing is to draw out money from this knowledge bank(built during the college days) as and when required, but sooner or later it would dry up in lieu of inadequate repayments that are far from being commensurate with the withdrawals.    </div>
