<p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;"><font size="3">Good!!.... adaptation and improvisation but your weakness is not your technique ....its your mind!!!!</font></p>
<p align="justify">How can the most important and sophisticated instrument of creation be a weakness, how can a neural network formed to perfection capable of handling any eventuality be flawed, how can millions of neurons working in absolute tandem fail!!!  how can the flawless overlap of classical and quantum domains be erroneous... !  It just can not be!!!</p>
<p align="justify">So the subject here is not mind, it is a mind that is jacked in! A mind that sees just the boundaries and not beyond .... a mind that has become so inert that the only reality that it believes in is limitation. A mind that has forgotten to make quantum jumps and is hopelessly dependent on the classical learning. A mind guided by moods and fantasies a mind that has no clue of what it is capable of doing. In such a mind lies all the weaknesses and such a mind is fit to be plugged into the power house of the cave! A mind that is now nothing more than a copper top!! A mind that was initially designed to generate revelations and innovations .. now all it generates is the BTUs...... cheers!!!!</p>
