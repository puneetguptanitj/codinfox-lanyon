<p style="text-align:justify;" dir="ltr">Finally something useful. Cinema and media in general are often seen as an attempt to escape from reality (along with its cumbersome problems and their unforeseeable solutions) into a neverland where either suddenly everything is beautiful or in most cases turns out that way eventually. This is terribly unrealistic. This is pretty similar to why people do drugs. Escapism even for a little while, seldom helps. But there is another side of this spectrum as well, where the reality is depicted in the crudest form, with utter disregard to hope and lacking even slightest traces of optimism.<br />
Satyamev Jayte takes a different route. A middle path, if u will. An attempt to show society its own reflection, the way it is today, without any attempt to hide or manipulate the truth. Two things happen when we try to be true to ourselves. First we become fearless. Second we try to improve. Both are monumental achievements. It is critical here though that truth be told in a completely non judgmental way. People tend to be good listeners when they are not judged, neither the victims nor those who are culpable.<br />
Indeed the episodes come with some horrifying stories of inhuman behaviour from the most unexpected people. Yes it arouses anger and disgust and leaves a big question mark on where we are taking our collective being. But it also embraces the people who despite being in the most awfully dreadful situations gather the courage to not just change their reality, rather are also brave enough to share their experiences for common good. This is why i consider this attempt as phenomenal.<br />
Its been long since we have used the most widespread medium of communication in a constructive way. To simply sit and talk about problems and figure out what we can do about them. No matter how dark the reality be, its analysis can always be optimistic. I applaud SJ’s  team on their commitment to integrity, and for always ending with positive note. Songs are a wonderful medium of expression in their own right but when tied with such powerful context they can change lives.<br />
If we are not liking what we are seeing in the mirror, the problem isn’t in the image or the mirror, its in us. Accepting the problem is the first step towards finding the solution. The way these problems have persisted though makes me question the way in which we have dealt with them or perhaps depicted them, clearly neither manipulation nor exaggeration of facts has helped. Hopefully this honest effort would. It is tremendously relieving and equally inspiring that in the end as it always has, truth and truth alone prevails.. and thankfully so.</p>
