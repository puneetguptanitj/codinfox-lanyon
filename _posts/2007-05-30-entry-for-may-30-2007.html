<p style="font-weight:bold;text-align:center;"><font size="3">What is so fascinating about synchronization</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A cadet striding ahead might impress us but when thousands of soldiers march forward in perfect rhythm, their steps seem to rock the ground below, their heads held high fill us with national pride. Had this synchronization been missing, even twice as many soldiers might not have drawn so much attention. It is the synergy that strikes the chord somewhere, which forces people watching them to salute back with rock steady hands. I used to wonder why should this happen what is so special about this unity in steps and actions, how does synchronization exude so much fascination?!!  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Two waves with intensities I1 and I2 when interfere constructively the resultant intensity is not simply addition of I1 and I2 it is twice of root I1*I2 more than that ... the whole is greater than sum of the parts!!!something that i had come across in physics so often, just that i never looked at it that way.  the only prerequisite is that we must meet in phase!!  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is this resonance that adorns the otherwise bland act of walking together. It is this additional component that comes from nowhere and makes their effort, to not just add up ..but add up in style!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the same way when people work together to interfere constructively issues get resolved problems get solved, projects get finished and arduous journeys come to fruition, obstacles kneel down and success says to synergy ... you did it again!!!</p>
