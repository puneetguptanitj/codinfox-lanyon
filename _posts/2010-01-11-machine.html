<p style="text-align:center;">Sometimes I wish I were a machine</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">aloof, alone, indifferent but serene</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">free from anger, boredom or fear</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">distant from all, having no one very dear</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">devoid of feelings or cravings of any kind</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">i would have had just rules, guiding my foolproof mind</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I would have had no yearnings to grow</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">for the world to be a stage or for being an actor in the show</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I would have had clear algorithms to run</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">i might have given some core dumps, but only for fun</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I would have been alone i know</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">but things would have been so much better</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">no unnecessary diversions no useless chatter</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">only set rules, guarding my limited intelligence</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">no bending of protocols, no more ambivalence</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">nobody would have been close, no one too far</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">no bonds would have broken, no relationship had turned sour</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">i would have followed my path with flawless precision</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">not being subdued by feelings, while making any decision</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">how wonderfully would I have fulfilled my purpose,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">how well would I have enjoyed my solitude</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">how selflessly would I have performed by duties,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">how honestly would I have expressed my gratitude.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">how peaceful would have been such a life</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">how painless would have been death</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">how silent would have been the departure how patient each breath</p>
