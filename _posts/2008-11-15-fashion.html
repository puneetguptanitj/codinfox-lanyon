<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>All that glitters is not gold, and definitely won't glitter all the time.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fashion is a powerful and immensely intense movie. The amount of research which must have went in making the movie is evident in every frame and every character. Each scene seems inherently connected to the next. Music blends with songs and fills the sequences with strong emotions. Life of a model from the days of struggle, to the top and back ..displays not just the reality of the glamorous world but also life in general. Truth behind the all pleasing fashion shows is not that pleasant. The glittering professional life of these celebrities hides their tough, torn and fragmented personal life. They live with dreams flying high but also with desperate desire to hold on to the roots. Its not long when despite all efforts roots are lost. When they find themselves at the top but hopelessly lonely. All that is left is baseless dreams and a false jubilation in perceived unreal identity. Then life shows the tough side and things start falling out of place. You fall just as fast as you had ascended. When only cause for the downfall seems to be the height that you had attained. Every thing is lost money, status and self. Some turn to the path of no return and die an anonymous death. When a shining star reduces to nothing more than dust. Is reality so harsh... it sure is! Bhandarkar with his usual style never loses the grip on the movie. He touches so many parts of the fashion world that anybody else would have digressed. Each character has a part to play. They are not there just to garnish or spice up some bland moments. They come and act in their own right and bland moments?!.. there are none. Bhandarkar is the king of showing reality as it is. If there is a director with sense, sensibility and style.. its him.</p>
