<p style="text-align:justify;">Designer babies is the article that triggered this blog. Designer babies!! you can order the type of child you want and charlatans armed with unwieldy gadgetry of new age science will bring it to the table. Is it a just another honest scientific exploration, just another giant leap for the mankind. I don't think so. I think someone has to draw a line somewhere. It cannot go on like this. Technology is not a science anymore, it seems, and neither is it only limited to few means meant make life simpler. It is breathing now, it has a life of its own. Is it bad or is it good, might be the next question but before that we would have to ponder, is it going the way we had planned. I reckon it isn't. We do not seem to have any plans, people (amateurs of course) are trying (for fun and/or hobby) genetic experiments in their garages. The line, whatever little of it we had, has already been crossed. What if these seemingly genuine attempts, commence an uncontrollable disaster. What if it goes beyond any amends. We would be reduced to mere spectators of the aftermath of our insatiable curiosity. Technology has indeed made life simpler but has also made the problems much more complex, it is pacing up with imagination, god help us when it goes past it.</p>
