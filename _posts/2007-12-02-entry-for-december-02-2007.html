<div style="text-align:justify;">
<div style="text-align:center;"><strong>If Chak De was the coming of age of Indian Cinema, OSO was certainly its journey back to infancy!! Mind IT!! </p>
<p> </strong></div>
<p>For the entire movie farah khan tries to keep the viewers on their seats by reassuring that Picute abhi baki hai! but the viewers keep wondering what the "fish"!! is going on, then they hear that phrase for the last time only to realize that oh its done! Exaggerated emotions, senseless scenes, pathetic direction and absolutely absurd continuum of frames make it difficult to comprehend the very intent of the director, the first half went like a flash of stupidity, and the second like a terrible continuation of insanity. When SRK cries Bhagoo!! in the first part I think he must have had meant it!! Believe me I had expected lot more mature stuff from someone who had given a hit in her debut film venture. I had thought that she would be giving a full fledged entertainer but it was a bundle of fatuous jokes which she astonishingly expected the viewers would just lump in. But for the six abs of SRK and derde disco it would have been a complete derde fiasco. SRK's presence indeed invariably electrified few tracks and added the fascination that was enough to give the movie the required initial and of course Deepika's awesome looks kept the people coming, but they all must have had the same thing in mind after watching it ...what the hell was that!! how can SRK and Deepika say yes for such a crap. Some little pieces of advice for the trinity </p></div>
<div style="margin-left:40px;">â€¢ farah khan ..take some rest (preferrably a long sabbatical!)<br />  â€¢ srk.. get some beard<br />  â€¢ deepika ..keep going (you are unbelievable!)</div>
