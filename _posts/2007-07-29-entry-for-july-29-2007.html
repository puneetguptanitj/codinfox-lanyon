<div style="text-align:center;"><font size="3"><strong>From chitrahaar to you tube...</strong></font></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">     It wasn't that long back when we used to watch chitrahar especially during our exam days for some recreation. Wednesday 8pm used to be the slot for this very sought for serial. Internet used to be something really costly and restricted to only internet cafÃ©s ... <span> </span>floppy discs used to be treasured as a place to store loads of information! A speed around 48 kbps used to be so satisfying ... but technology begets more technology .. rate of rise here is exponential. With each new advent paving the way for numerous like adventures in the reign of man's innovation and quest for unknown. Soon floppy disc became obsolete and cds took over the market only to give way to DVDs and usb drives. Now even usb drives seem to be only a reasonably large storage. Yahoo needs to process ,as one of their hoardings on MG road so happily displays, 250TB of data every day. Internet has entered virtually every home and every laptop and internet cafÃ©s have sprouted in almost all the streets. Speed of information transfer these days is limited only by the speed of light due to the incompetencies of matter!! When you operate on the very quantum of nature to bring about some change the cumulation of the results would obviously be mammoth. Fiber to home, mobile phones and digital <span> </span>money has transformed the way we used to treat technology. It is no longer the bastion of technocrats it is a necessity for all irrespective of their status or the walk of life. Only the extent varies The customer base of technology is growing faster than we had imagined. Integration of multimedia and communication has fueled the growth of technology and resources have pooled in from all directions as now technology targets not just limited areas of R&amp;D it now targets the masses. Even a rickshaw driver complains of poor mobile network these days. When a simple website where people are free to upload their videos can be a matter of serious discussion <span> </span>in the presidential election of the world's super power, we can well understand that things are no longer the same. They would never be. Where are we going !! nobody knows for sure but all agree that we are in a great hurry!! Thanks to the silicon sand and a few naughty electrons playing through it. </p>
