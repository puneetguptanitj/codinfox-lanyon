<div style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;"><font size="3">The greatest and probably the only true alchemist...TIME<br /></font></div>
<p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Alchemy is the predecessor of chemistry that sought to change a base metal (any base metal) to gold. Thats what time does ..with human metals. Of course the ways that it adopts donot appear to be of our liking and we seldom understand the detours it offers when we appear to move so smoothly over our path. Grinding is what gives shine to the diamond, I think time takes this advice too seriously!! And sometimes i am not able to comprehend why does it like diamonds anyway!! Those who are afraid of people are put in the midst of a flok of dominating champions, those who cannot face defeat are made to fall from the highest summit, Those who are impatient are made to wait and watch longer than a normal person can withstand. Those who are arrogant are made to lose when they seemed to have no parallel. But when a person is persistent enough to win, generous enough to give way, kind enough to help, humble enough to admit mistakes, time delighted with its efforts says here is another piece of gold.. i just need to keep it shiny!!.</div>
