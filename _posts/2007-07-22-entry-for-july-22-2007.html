<div style="text-align:center;"><font size="3"><strong>Universalism</strong></font></p>
</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Gandhiji had adopted a non-violent nationalism and identified it with a sense of universalism. But that notion of identity has been defeated all together by the current state of rising feeling of sectarianism. Demagogues are rousing such sentiments and using them to sustain their own false sense of importance and power. However these netas are not the only one culpable, there are other reasons for the rise of such feelings. Globilisation and the information revolution has made the world a small place to live in. Regions are merging in and a global race is coming into being, in such an integration excess of individualism sometimes leads to loneliness when people find it hard to associate themselves to people around them. That's the uglier side of being independent! When they long for threads that they feel no longer exist. This lack of association leads them to hung up to any form of relationship that would bind them into some community. Let it be jews in Russia or whites in zimbabwe or chinese in Philippines who though are in minority but own quite a good chunk of economy of the states they live in. Such people are happy enough to be called a minority as even that tends to statisfy their thirst of some association with the their fellow members. These feelings are the best for the false leaders who claim to be the protagonist of such communities, to prop up from no where and start an imaginary struggle for greater independence and autonomy for the community they so blithely presume to represent. This increasing individualism should not be considered evil, or something that we have to fight rather should be used as a ladder to facilitate the arrival of a time when the world would truly be a global village, to facilitate the application of the notion of a universalism where people are separate because the are not attached but because no other attachment is required any longer. So that the states like Britain donot end up being sum of few segregated racial groups who keep on fighting for some reason or the other .. rather transforms them in an agglomeration of individuals where the only guiding principle for formation of any rules or commandments is to be better individuals and <span> </span>more human!</p>
