<p style="text-align:center;"><font size="3"><strong>A STRANGER IN DISGUISE</strong></font></p>
<p>Few days back I happened to meet a stranger. He stayed with me for a while and I soon realised that he was rather a true friend. Not that he did something great for me..but  how I felt being with him. It was quite a different and cathartic experience. I later came to know that he had tried to come to me lot many times before as well only I didnot listen. I probably was too busy with my life. <br /> He didnot talk much but preferred to listen most of the times. It seemed as if he could listen to all my problems without blinking even once! I could see deeper inside myself and could understand myself better when he was around. The best part was that I could easily go to him anytime and he was always eager to be with me. <br /> I felt so much better after talking to him. The other day when we were together doorbell rang and I didn't like that at all... still as I went to open the door my friend said "I would have to go now". I said "Oh... ok ...see you soon". He said don't worry I will be around! .."but I don't even know your name!!" I shouted<br />   .....He smiled and said "...People call me Solitude!!!" </p>
