<p style="text-align:center;">"<font size="4"><strong>What is the matrix ..control!" ..Morpheus</strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So as you can see , feel touch and sense in any form that the matrix is not just illusion. It is the illusion that someone else controls you. Every step you take to reach to your office, every eye that watches you move, every colleague that says a hello tends to make an impact on you and is part of that control. Try to stop for a while and look around, try and see beyond the obvious, try and remove yourself from the surroundings, can you feel how insignificant you are, that there is more to what you see than what meets the eyes. That there appears to be an underlying system that frames our perceptions. That there is someone out there watching you and instructing you about how you should feel. We have been living in a dream world so pathetically tied to the fantasies that we would rather like to continue to sleep, to stay away from the reality. Plato would not have guessed in his wildest of thoughts that someone in todays world 22 centuries after he put forward his allegory of cave, would take him so seriously and would dare to go ahead and portray his cave. "The pill you took was part of a trace program to disrupt the input output signals, and pin point your location" Morpheus tries to explain it to Neo but ends up confusing him still further!  which location was he referring to... location of Neo's body in the cave(or the endless fields where human beings were grown as Wachowskis call it). Neo is jacked in the Matrix pods for years now..so much so that even the muscles of his eyes are aching. Pain after being taken out of the control was enormous .. his body fragile and weak. Holes all round his spinal chord to feed his mind with signals which his mind used to process and thus gave illusion of reality.  Is it so hard to believe Morpheus asks Neo, that even the reality is a program, built over rules that can be bent or broken. What if we say no to that external control, what if we try to open our eyes, what if we let it all go, fear , doubt and disbelief, what if we free our minds, we would no longer be bound by the limitations of the illusion. We would be able to make choices independent of any indulgences from outside. We would begin to believe! That every stimulus we receive every impulse we get is part of the matrix which is how that system administers control over us, but we can make an independent choice free from any control, that we can have an identity that is not guided by anybody, that each one of us has the potential of being the one!!</p>
