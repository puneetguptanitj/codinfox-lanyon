<div style="text-align:center;"><font size="3"><strong>POWER OF WORDS</strong></font></div>
<p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Fearless India, is it yet another cricket story or chakde saga .. yes but i was prompted to write it not after srisanth's catch but what actually caught my attention was an article in Sunday times. Let euphoria fill the space of fear, enjoy the game and give it your best. These were the words of Dhoni to his men, despite the debacles in the current series, I admire the way words can drive any group to unbelievable success. It was such a simple comment. But proved to be immensely powerful, and probably changed everything about 20-20. Small is powerful as was the slogan "Karo ya maro" 3 words that changed the future of billions. Fetters of slavery were broken, wings flung wide open, with eyes towards the sky and freedom at the horizon, Words are more powerful than any muscle. A simple word of appreciation, a word of contempt, or a word of motivation can change lives. That is why probably it is important to harness this energy properly. Just as a simple word of admiration can change the way people see you a simple word of reckless criticism can alienate the closest friends. The subconscious however has no filtering mechanism, it lets in the energy of positive words with as much ease as it lets in its negative counterpart. Every incidence leaves an imprint, every reaction is noted, every action is judged and stored. In this deluge of information and energy it is actually a good idea to let euphoria come into picture and rule the game. No matter how dismal the ambiance be, how boring the routine be or how meger the chattels be lets just forget and laugh straight from the heart. Lets garnish the power of words, lets add a smile to every "hi" , lets shake hands with firmness, lets meet every body in the eye. Let there be a euphoria of positivism, let us close the fists again and say chake de once more!!</div>
