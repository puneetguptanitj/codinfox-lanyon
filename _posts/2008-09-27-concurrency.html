<p style="text-align:center;">Nature's concurrent programming</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imagine a world were one child can come only when the one coming before has died! I mean imagine a world with compulsive and not just seeming serialization. It would be grossly inefficient. Concurrency is conspicuously obvious in nature. When you are sleeping your subconscious is assimilating and sorting out whatever you experienced today. Earth is moving with much urgency to let the long forgotten half get some sunshine! Ice is busy melting and plants are all worked up about giving oxygen, among other things. Nothing really is happening one at a time. You are getting older so are you younger cousins, some people are ready to come while some are all set to leave. So questions can arise about not just the deliberate parallelism but also the undeniable magnitude of it. People increase in GP, resources in AP (something similar to Moore's law) when finally it occurs to nature, that it is running short of resources to cater to so many strands of life, it thus willingly or unwillingly triggers "garbage collection". Only that it is not that precise and takes a toll on even pretty relevant and well referenced entities. Nonetheless stage is set for yet another melodrama. Cities get drowned, or shaken up till all the houses are back to where they came from, people leaving for offices never return, while some return only to die at home. Meaning thereby that enough space is made for new life threads to start afresh. This whole seemingly infinite state machine, as it appears, is powered by and for itself. The idea behind billions of colors, multitude of life forms from lichens to dianasours is undecipherable. In computers concurrency solves some purpose, it is directed to some end which is outside the domain of computers themselves. But why should not there be more meaning out of this mesh of lifes, why should there be expanse only for a final collapse why should there be life only for death. Why should things start only to end and end only to start all over. Whats generated is consumed and whats consumed is used to generate. Why should nature be so vast and complex and why should it bother about efficiency at all, why not one plant at a time, one life at a time.</p>
