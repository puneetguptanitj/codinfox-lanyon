<p>Am I dead, puzzeled Neo asks Morpheus. "Far from it" is the reply he gets. Why is far from being dead an achievement one might wonder. But pain doesn't allow him to think about anything else.Â  Every cell of his body seems to be tied to some invisible string. He can't move his hands or legs or head. He can't even open his eyes. Tied completely he lies dead still. What is this pull, these strings.. is it just gravity. Why can't he move freely the way his thoughts are moving right now?!</p>
